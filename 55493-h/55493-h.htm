<h2>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>
<hr class="r10" />

<p class="noindent">The following squib was written in 1883, with the intention
of drawing attention to the serious danger into which we are
rapidly drifting, through the suicidal policy of our rulers.</p>

<p>Since it was written the evils indicated therein have
greatly increased in intensity.</p>

<p>The interests of the producers having been completely
sacrificed to those of the consumers; the results of such a
policy are becoming painfully apparent, in the increasing
number of the unemployed, consequent on <em>unlimited foreign
competition</em>.</p>

<p>Working men who are unable to obtain employment can
no longer be persuaded, either by the plausible statistics of
Mr. Giffen, or by the peevish denunciations of Mr. Bright,
that, thanks to Free Trade, they are better off than they
were ever before.</p>

<p>Cheap food is of little avail if the means of purchasing it
be not forthcoming.</p>

<p>The cry for <em>fair</em> trade is waxing stronger and stronger.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured to show that a light tax on foreign
wheat, would, without any appreciable increase in the cost
of food, probably enrich England and its dependencies to
the extent of about £60,000,000 annually; whilst at present
a large portion of this is employed in furnishing the sinews
of war which will probably be used against us.</p>

<span class="fs70">TO THE VOTARIES OF JUGERNATH.</span></h2>


<p>My Idolatrous Compatriot! Were it not for the gravity
of the situation, it would be amusing to watch the self-complacent
smile of conscious superiority which you assume,
when descanting on the paternal character of our rule in
suppressing such abuses as those of Suttee and Jugernāth;
unconscious at the same time that the Jugernāth of the
wretched Hindoo is dwarfed into complete insignificance
when compared with that huge idol which you yourself have
set up for worship.</p>

<p>My dear fellow! for goodness’ sake put away the microscope
with which you are so patiently investigating the mote
in the eye of your Aryan brother, and bear with me,
whilst I attempt to extract the huge log which obscures
your own visual organs. And should I (contrary to my
expectation), succeed in removing so large a mass, you will
find that, whilst you have been depriving your Aryan
brethren of their comparatively innocent little plaything,
which at the most might have crushed some half dozen
fanatics, in the course of a year, you have reared up a
horrible fantastic creation which you worship, which in its
progress is crushing its thousands and even millions every
year; which is stamping out the lifeblood of England and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
its dependencies; whilst all the time you are applauding it,
sounding your political tom-toms, blowing your trumpets to
shouts of wah! wah! complacently misapplying glib quotations
from your sacred Vedas (Adam Smith and Mill),
flaunting your banners of political economy while violating
every principle of that useful but misused science.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER II.</a><br />

<span class="fs70">THE BLASPHEMER.</span></h2>


<p>Now, my Friend, I am not sanguine enough to expect a
patient hearing from you whilst I revile that idol which you
have set up with sound of sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and
other kinds of (un)musical instruments.</p>

<p>I am perfectly aware that I shall be cast, by you, into the
fiery furnace of criticism; I can imagine, in anticipation,
the vials of your wrath poured out on my unlucky head;
and I don’t expect to escape like our friends Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego.</p>

<p>I am not composed of those materials of which martyrs
are made.</p>

<p>I know full well that I shall writhe horribly under the
taunt of “ungrammatical twaddle,” for how can I hope to
escape an occasional slip of the pen, of which even the
heaven-born “Covenanted Civilian” is not always innocent.</p>

<p>I shall wriggle under the analysis of my “illogical reasoning,”
my “exploded theories,” my “faulty statistics.”</p>

<p>I shall squirm under the exposure of my “ignorance of
facts,” my “want of knowledge of political economy,” my
“antiquated notions.”</p>

<p>That I shall suffer severely for my blasphemy I know
right well; but I cannot help it. Strike!! but hear me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>I am weary to death of the claptrap and imposition with
which your votaries applaud their idol, and attribute the
evils caused by it to anything but the right cause. I am
disgusted with the blind obstinacy with which you close
your eyes to the light of facts; besides, I have the selfish
feeling that, sooner or later, I may be jostled by admiring
votaries under the wheels of your car, whilst I shall not
have even the consolation of deluding myself that I am a
martyr ascending to the heaven of your Jugernāthian
mythology, but, on the contrary, a victim of your confounded
stupidity and obstinacy, and of the incompetence
or dishonesty of your leaders.</p>

<p>If I could only stand on the platform of any other
audience and address Americans, Dutch, Belgians, Germans,
or say Frenchmen, I might secure a sympathetic hearing.</p>

<p>The Frenchman would probably shrug his shoulders and
say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I quite agree with, you, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami! mais que voulez vous?</span> It
amuses these other English, and does not hurt us; on the contrary,
we profit by it. We furnish the gilt and gingerbread, the paint
and the unmusical instruments; and we are paid for them, vive
Jugernāth!! only don’t ask us to be fools enough to put ourselves
under its wheels.”</p></div>

<p>You, on the other hand, my friend, will naturally say:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Bah! these Americans, Dutch, Belgians, Germans, and French
are brutally stupid, and beyond the reach of argument; blind to
their own interests. We alone stand on the pinnacle of intelligence
in our worship of Jugernāth. Has not our High Priest, the G. O. M.,
swept away all your argument like chaff?”</p></div>

<p>Pardon me, my friend. The exuberant verbosity of the
G. O. M., combined with his misleading and incorrect
statistics, may easily silence an opponent in debate, but
they cannot alter stern facts; and facts are against your
idol. Your prophets prophesy falsely, and your people love
to have it so.</p>

<span class="fs90"><span class="smcap">What is Jugernath?</span></span></h2>


<p>Well! well!! I have put off the evil day as long as
possible; but sooner or later it must come out, even if you
have not already guessed it.</p>

<p>Stoop low while I whisper in your ear the name by which
this destructive fiend Jugernāth is known in England.
It is:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pfs100 smcap">Free Trade!!!</p>

<p>Yes! it is <em>Free trade</em> that has utterly ruined Ireland;
that is rapidly dragging England down under its wheels;
that drains the lifeblood of India and England’s dependencies.</p>

<p>Free trade is that idol which England worships, but which
brings in its train disaster, bankruptcy, pauperism, drunkenness,
and crime. It is Free trade that is destroying
England’s industries, and is driving her capital to protectionist
countries. It is Free trade that, if not soon
abandoned, will soon bring about a national bankruptcy in
England.</p>

<p>My dear fellow! I know your stale arguments by heart.
I have looked into your dishonest and fictitious statistics
and discovered their imposture. I know you can make glib
quotations from Adam Smith and Mill, and misapply them.
It is easy for you to prate about Political <em>Economy</em>, and at
the same time to practise Political <em>Extravagance</em>, of the
most ruinous description; but I ask you to leave theory for
a short time and look ugly facts straight in the face,
divesting your mind, if you can, of all prejudice. These
facts I will give you in the next chapter. But now don’t
misunderstand me. I am not a <em>rabid</em> protectionist. I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
not an advocate of Fair trade, Reciprocity, or Retaliation.
I hold that Protection, if carried beyond its legitimate
limits, is nearly as mischievous in its action as Free trade.
And that although “Fair trade,” “Reciprocity” and
“Retaliation” are cries that have been evoked by the evils
that Free trade has brought upon us, yet they are wrong in
practice, as an attempt at a compromise with an utterly
false principle; and I am glad that the movement has
collapsed.</p>

<p>I hold that Free trade is entirely wrong in principle and
disastrous in results. Every argument of the free-trader is
based on the <em>misuse</em>, not upon the <em>proper use</em>, of Protection.</p>

<p>Every so-called triumphant exposure of the evils caused
by Protection has simply been an exposure of the evils of
Protection carried <em>beyond its legitimate limits</em>.</p>

<p>The Corn Laws, to which Free trade owes its existence,
were an instance of undue protection; they urgently required
<em>alteration</em>, not <em>repeal</em>. Free trade advocates are unable to
distinguish the difference between the use and the misuse
of a principle. In their abhorrence of its misuse, they would
sweep it away altogether. They are about as reasonable as
the man who discovers that too much food will cause indigestion,
and therefore proposes, as an infallible law of political
economy, the dogma that no food whatever is to be
taken. And they stigmatize as “simpletons without memory
or logic,” as men “beyond the reach of argument”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> those
who decline to accept the Free trade gospel of starvation.</p>

<span class="fs70">A FEW UGLY FACTS.</span></h2>


<p>I have said that facts are against your idol, let me advance
a few of them:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block">

<p>&nbsp; (1.) &nbsp; The prophecies made by the originators of free trade
have proved to be false.</p>

<p>&nbsp; (2.) &nbsp; England stands alone as a free-trader. Free trade, at
the present time, is either an English, or a barbarous
custom.</p>

<p>&nbsp; (3.) &nbsp; France made a partial trial of free trade, but has
drawn back and refused to continue the commercial
treaty.</p>

<p>&nbsp; (4.) &nbsp; Increased wealth,&mdash;due to improvements in science,
steam, and electricity, although dishonestly claimed
the work of free trade,&mdash;has been shared by all
civilized nations.</p>

<p>&nbsp; (5.) &nbsp; Protectionist countries have made <em>greater relative
advance</em> in prosperity than England.</p>

<p>&nbsp; (6.) &nbsp; The exceptional prosperity of the years 1871&ndash;73 was
due to a partial <em>suspension of free trade</em> caused
by the Franco-Prussian war.</p>

<p>&nbsp; (7.) &nbsp; The rise of wages in England,&mdash;dishonestly claimed
as the work of free trade,&mdash;has been shared by
Protectionist countries.</p>

<p>&nbsp; (8.) &nbsp; The statistics of decrease of crime and pauperism&mdash;claimed
as the work of free trade&mdash;are fictitious
and misleading.</p>

<p>&nbsp; (9.) &nbsp; Protectionist America is passing Free Trade England
by “in a canter.”</p>

<p>(10.) &nbsp; Protectionist America contrasts favourably with
Free Trade Canada.</p>

<p>(11.) &nbsp; Canada having lately departed from free trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
principles, is satisfied with the result, and
clamours for more protection.</p>

<p>(12.) &nbsp; The Colony of Victoria, which has departed
farthest from the principles of free trade, is the
most prosperous of the Australian Colonies.</p>

<p>(13.) &nbsp; Free Trade Ireland contrasts unfavourably with
Protectionist Holland, which has every natural
disadvantage.</p>

<p>(14.) &nbsp; The agricultural industry of Ireland has been
destroyed, and Ireland ruined by free trade.</p>

<p>(15.) &nbsp; The manufacturing industries of Ireland, which
flourished under protection, have become extinct
under free trade.</p>

<p>(16.) &nbsp; English agricultural industries are rapidly being
ruined by free trade.</p>

<p>(17.) &nbsp; In the last eleven years, about 1,200,000, acres
have gone out of tillage in the United Kingdom,
and about 7,400,000 acres are lying fallow.</p>

<p>(18.) &nbsp; Numerous farms are untenanted, or let at nominal
rates.</p>

<p>(19.) &nbsp; The loss to the agricultural classes within the last
few years has been estimated at £150,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>(20.) &nbsp; Many English landowners are realizing what they
can from the wreck, and investing the capital in
Protectionist America.</p>

<p>(21.) &nbsp; English manufacturing industries are, for the most
part, on the high road to ruin.</p>

<p>(22.) &nbsp; Silk industry is nearly extinct in England.</p>

<p>(23.) &nbsp; Cotton and woollen industries are struggling hard
for existence.</p>

<p>(24.) &nbsp; Iron industries are said to have lost £160,000,000
in four years.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
<p>(25.) &nbsp; Protectionist countries have outstripped England
in relative increase of commerce.</p>

<p>(26.) &nbsp; The accumulation of wealth is increasing more
rapidly in Protectionist France than in England,
in spite of a disastrous war, a heavy war indemnity,
a civil war, and an unsettled form of
Government.</p>

<p>(27.) &nbsp; Land cultivation is increasing in Protectionist
France and decreasing in Free Trade England.</p>

<p>(28.) &nbsp; The relative increase in the production of iron is
greater in Protectionist countries than in
England.</p>

<p>(29.) &nbsp; The relative increase in general manufacture is
Greater in Protectionist countries than in
England.</p>

<p>(30.) &nbsp; The working classes, by whom free trade was
carried, though nominally free-traders, are
practically extreme protectionists.</p>

<p>(31.) &nbsp; The working classes, whenever they have obtained
predominant influence, have become protectionists.</p></div>

<div class="block fs80">

<p>(32.) &nbsp; “The revenue returns continue to exhibit a stagnant tendency
<em>under all the heads which are considered tests of
national prosperity</em>.” (Telegraphic Summary of News,
<cite>Civil and Military Gazette</cite>, December 7th, 1883.)</p>

<p>(33.) &nbsp; “It is predicted that, unless Freight rates to India speedily
improve, a considerable number of steamers now engaged
in the trade will be laid up.” (<cite>Civil and Military
Gazette</cite>, December 7th, 1883.)</p>

<p>(34.) &nbsp; “Gloomy predictions are uttered about the immediate
future of our iron-trade. Few fresh orders are coming
in, and stocks are consequently increasing in an alarming
manner.” (<cite>Civil and Military Gazette</cite>, December
7th, 1883.)</p>

<p>(35.) &nbsp; “Again it is alleged that the principles of free trade, which
have been adopted in this country, have tended, in a
great degree, to produce the disastrous results which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
we have at present to contend against, and which present
a gloomy look-out for the cotton operatives of
this country.” (<cite>The Mail</cite>, December 19th, 1883.)</p>

<p>(36.) &nbsp; “It is the intention of the leading men among the cotton
operatives to move next session for a Royal Commission
to enquire as to what extent, if any, we suffer from
foreign competition, and <em>what bearing our system of
free trade</em> may have on the question.” (<cite>The Mail</cite>,
December 19th, 1883.)</p></div>

<p>Before I proceed to substantiate the facts above given, I
wish to clear the ground by a few axioms which I think few
will venture to dispute.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />

<span class="fs70">POLITICAL ECONOMY.</span></h2>


<p>Do not suppose, my Friend, that I am opposed to <em>political
economy</em>; I am simply opposed to <em>your application of its
principles</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Let me illustrate my meaning by a comparison between
Mathematics and Political Economy:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mathematics may be divided into two classes&mdash;“pure”
and “applied.”</p>

<p>Political economy may be divided into two similar classes&mdash;“pure”
and “applied.”</p>

<p><em>Pure</em> Mathematics, being an exact science, is infallible.</p>

<p><em>Pure</em> Political economy, being a matter of opinion, is not
infallible; but let us for the moment suppose it to be
so.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><em>Applied</em> mathematics are not always sound; for example,
in applying mathematics to Engineering problems, it is by
no means uncommon to find that they appear to err most
egregiously; so much so, as to give rise to the saying, that
“theory and practice contradict one another.” The fact, in
reality, being that theory has not been correctly applied;
that innumerable small factors, which can only be ascertained
by practice and experience, have been neglected in the
application of theory; and even practice often fails to supply
these factors.</p>

<p><em>Applied</em> Political Economy is under similar conditions, but
with this difference: <em>1st</em>, that <em>pure</em> Political Economy is not
infallible; <em>2nd</em>, that the application of Political Economy is
affected by a greater number of intricate factors than any
ordinary problem in Engineering; <em>3rd</em>, that the observation
of results in a complex question of Applied Political
Economy is far more difficult than in the case of those simple
materials which are dealt with in Engineering problems.</p>

<p>The eminent Italian Political Economist, Luigi Cossa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
warns the student of this difficulty; but free-trading “fools
rush in where angels fear to tread.”</p>

<p>He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is needful to hold ourselves aloof equally from the so-called
Doctrinaires who refuse the assistance of practice, and from the
Empiricists who obstinately close their eyes to the light of theory.</p>

<p><em>The Pure science</em> explains phenomena and determines laws; the
<em>Applied</em> science gives guiding principles, which practice brings into
conformity with the innumerable varieties of individual cases.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></div>

<p>Mill also says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of the peculiarities of modern times,&mdash;the separation of
theory from practice,&mdash;of the studies of the closet from the outward
business of the world,&mdash;has given a wrong bias to the ideas
and feelings both of the student and of the man of business.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> ...
There is almost always room for a modest doubt as to our practical
conclusions.”</p></div>

<p>Let us take an example of pure and applied science.</p>

<p>You, my Friend, quote an axiom of Pure Political
Economy when you say:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is unjust to tax all for the benefit of <em>one class</em>” So far
I quite agree with you;&mdash;it is to your <em>application</em> of the
<em>axiom</em> that I object, when you go on to say&mdash;“therefore
protection in any shape is wrong.” Your application of
pure science to the complex question of free trade is quite
incorrect.</p>

<p>I say “<em>it is just and expedient to tax all for the benefit of
all</em>.” I hold that the employment of home and colonial
labour, and the development of home and colonial produce
and industries, is for the benefit of the community as a
whole; and that, consequently, protection, if <em>carried only to
the extent necessary to secure this, and no further</em>, is just and
expedient.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The Corn Laws, as existing in 1846, went beyond this:
and their <em>alteration</em>, not their <em>abolition</em>, was needed. Your
free-trader’s argument is like that of a man who has discovered
that too much water will drown, and proceeds at
once to the other extreme of killing by thirst.</p>

<p><em>All extremes are bad.</em> Free trade is an <em>extreme</em>. Want of
competition is bad. Extreme competition is bad. <em>Healthy</em>
competition is that which is wanted.</p>

<p>Unlimited competition defeats its own purpose by crushing
out weaker industries, diminishing the supply, and
enabling the successful competitors to raise their prices as
soon as the rival industry has been extinguished.</p>

<p>Even Mill admits that protection may</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“be defensible when imposed temporarily ... in hopes of naturalizing
a foreign industry.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p></div>

<p>And Cossa allows that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At certain times, and under certain conditions, protection has
given notable advantages to industrial organization and progress....
Colbert’s system and Cromwell’s Navigation Act, contributed
not a little to the economic greatness of France and England.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p></div>

<p>There seems to be but little doubt that the political
economist of the future will hold up England as an awful
warning, but an instructive example, of a country ruined by
the persistent misapplication of the principles of political
economy.</p>

<p>Alexr. Hamilton, the greatest statesman America ever
produced, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Though it were true that the immediate and certain effect of
regulations controlling the competition of foreign and domestic
fabrics was an increase of price, it is universally true that the contrary
is the ultimate effect with every successful manufacture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>When a domestic manufacture has been brought to perfection and has
engaged in the prosecution of it a competent number of persons it
invariably becomes cheaper. * * * The internal competition which
takes place soon does away with anything like monopoly, and by
degrees reduces the price of the article to the minimum of reasonable
profit on the capital. (Treasury Report Dec. 1791.)&mdash;<cite>Fortnightly
Review</cite>, 1873.</p></div>

<p>It is not merely your misapplication of the principles of
political economy to which I object; I also object to the
over-bearing way in which you thrust down the throat of
your opponent the opinions of your favourite political
economists, as if they were infallible and settled the
question beyond all possibility of further argument. This is
especially the case when you quote Mill. Now Mill is no
doubt an eminently able and powerful writer; but he is
deplorably subject to mistakes. He constantly contradicts
himself, and is contradicted by political economists equally
able and more reliable than himself. For example, Professor
Bonamy Price<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> accuses Mill of introducing <em>utter confusion</em>
into the topic of Wages.</p>

<p>Cossa speaks of Mill’s “ardent concessions to socialism
more apparent than real;” of his “<em>narrow philosophic utilitarianism</em>.”</p>

<p>Also, speaking of Thornton, Cossa says:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His book on labour is an excellent one; it made a great impression
on Mill, and caused him to <em>abandon his theory of wages
fund</em>; which has also been opposed by Lange, by the American
Economist Walker, and by Bretano.”</p></div>

<p>Many of the inaccuracies of Mill have been exposed by
Professor Cairnes.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Cook says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mill, however, is said to have <em>abandoned the seesaw theory</em> in his
latest and yet unpublished essays.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></div>

<p>Macleod also, in writing on the question of rent says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This does not exhaust the <em>absurdity</em> of the Ricardo-Mill theory
of rent ... but in fact <em>Mill himself has completely overthrown</em>
this theory of rent.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></div>

<p>Anyone who has carefully studied the writings of Mill
cannot fail to be struck with the manner in which he
allows that which Herbert Spencer terms “Political Bias,”
and which Cossa terms Mill’s “narrow philosophic utilitarianism,”
to affect his opinion, and warp his better judgment;
and when this is the case, he is guilty of absurdities,
inconsistencies, and illogical reasoning that would disgrace a
school-boy.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<span class="fs70">POLITICAL EXTRAVAGANCE.</span></h2>


<p>You are very fond, my Friend, of talking about political
economy. Suppose, for a change, we discuss a certain
political extravagance, of which you are guilty.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Look!” you say, “at the visible signs of prosperity caused
by free trade, our annual imports are in excess of our exports by
£100,000,000. This represents the annual accumulation of our
national wealth.”</p></div>

<p>Now, my friend, I want you to try and take a common-sense
view of things:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mill says, that “<em>saving</em> enriches, and spending impoverishes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>the community along with the individual.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Now let
us apply England’s action in this respect to the assumed
case of an individual. Suppose a farmer should allow his
land to go out of cultivation and purchase farm produce, for
his own consumption, from the open market; suppose at
the same time he has a limited supply of iron ore on his
estate, which he sells at a rate that does not quite cover the
cost of its production; would you argue that the more food
such a one purchased and consumed, and the more iron ore
he sold, the greater was his prosperity; and especially so
because he <em>consumed</em> more than he <em>sold</em>?</p>

<p>In my ignorance of political economy I should have said
that such a man was on the highroad to bankruptcy. Now
this is precisely what England is doing.</p>

<p>She is allowing her land to go out of cultivation. She is
purchasing from foreign countries food which she might
produce herself, and which, when consumed, leaves nothing
to show for the expenditure. Her manufacturing industries
are losing concerns; her shipping is carrying at nominal
rates; her iron industry has been losing at the rate of
£40,000,000 a year; and she is parting with her <em>limited
capital</em> of iron at a loss. The excess of Imports over
Exports does not represent wealth capable of accumulation,
but consists of consumable articles of food.</p>

<p>The annual imports of the principal staples of food in
1881 were:&mdash;</p>

<p>Besides these, there are butter, cheese, eggs, coffee, cocoa,
and other articles of food, which must probably amount to
something between 20 and 30 millions sterling. So that
the excess of £100,000,000 sterling is <em>entirely due to consumable
food, much of which might be produced in England</em>.
If this be not political extravagance, I am at a loss for a
definition of Extravagance. My friend, it appears to me
that you are burning the candle at both ends.</p>

<p>Mr. Leffingwell, an intelligent American, writes:<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Should the day ever arrive when most of her mills are silent,
her ‘Black country’ again green, her furnaces cold, her shops filled
with foreign wares, and her food brought from distant lands, it will
add little to her welfare that all other nations find a market on her
shores for the products of their factories and fields.”</p></div>

<p>Let us now hear what America has to say about free
trade:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If, during the last fifty years, America had permitted a system
of unrestricted trade with all the world, she would never have
reached that development of her manufactures which has rendered
her independent, but would to-day be little more than a huge
agricultural colony exchanging the produce of her fields for the
manufactures and fabrics of Europe.</p>

<p>“Under a system of protection America has been able to develop
her boundless mineral resources, to encourage the growth of her
manufacturing industries, until to-day she is not only independent
and able to supply her own needs, but she exports to foreign
nations, and has begun to compete with England for the trade of the
world.”</p></div>

<p>A few quotations from the utterances of our own countrymen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>may serve to show what Protection has done for
America:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The edge tool trade is well sustained, and we have less of the
effects of American competition. That this competition is severe,
however, is a fact that cannot be ignored, and it applies to many
other branches than that of edge tools. Every Canadian season
affords unmistakable evidence that some additional article in
English Hardware is being supplanted by the produce of the
Northern States; and it is notorious how largely American wares
are rivalling those of the mother country in others of our colonial
possessions as well as on the continent. The ascendency of the
protectionist party in the States continues to operate most
favourably for the manufacturing interests there, and it is no wonder
that under such benignant auspices the enterprise in this direction
is swelling to colossal proportions. The whole subject is one
demanding the serious attention of our manufacturers.” (Rylands’
Trade Circular, Birmingham, March 4th, 1871.)</p>

<p>“A leading manufacturer expressed himself startled and alarmed
at what he saw (at the Paris Exhibition) as the proofs of successful
rivalry on the part of the Americans in branches of his own trade.”
(Lectures at the Colonial Institution, November, 1878.)</p>

<p>“Unless our manufacturers bestir themselves, the Americans will
completely command the markets of Europe.” (Col. Wrottesby’s
Letter to the <cite>Times</cite>, July 6, 1869.)</p>

<p>“Manufactories have been <em>created and fostered by a system of
protection</em>, which, through enhanced prices paid by consumers, must
have been very costly to the nation, but of the result of which they
have reason to be proud, since it has made them to so great an
extent independent of other nations for their supply.” (Report of
Philadelphia Exhibition, Mr. P. Graham, Vice-President of the
Society of Arts.)</p>

<p>“The worsted manufacture of the United States is comparatively
of recent origin, but it has made very rapid progress during the
past ten or twelve years, the <em>high tariff having greatly stimulated its
development</em>.” (Report of Philadelphia Exhibition. Mr. H. Mitchel,
Member of Bradford Chamber of Commerce.)</p>

<p>“America is not only supplying her own country with goods,
but exporting her manufactures to such an extent that she has
become a powerful rival to England.” (Mr. Mundella, Nov. 21, 1874.)</p>

<p>“There is no time to be lost if we mean to hold our own in the
hardware trade.” (J. Anderson’s Report on Philadelphia Exhibition.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“For years Sheffield has supplied not only our own country, but
nearly the whole world. The monopoly remains with us no longer.
It would be foolish not to recognize the fact that at Philadelphia
Great Britain was in the face of a powerful rival in manufactures.”
(Report on Philadelphia Exhibition&mdash;D. McHardy.)</p>

<p>Some idea of the increase of American manufacture may be found
in the example of two items&mdash;Paper and Carpets.</p></div>

                     the Corn Law was utterly abolished, that agriculture sprung up into the full vigour of existence in England, to become what it is now, like the manufactures,

<p>Professor Cairnes says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The able men who led the agitation for the repeal of the Corn
Laws promised much more than this. They told us that the Poor
Laws were to follow the Corn Laws; that pauperism would disappear
with the restrictions upon trade, and the workhouses ere long
become obsolete institutions. I fear this part of the programme has
scarcely been fulfilled; those ugly social features, those violent contrasts
of poverty and wealth, that strike so unpleasantly the eye of
every foreign observer in this country, are still painfully prominent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>

<span class="fs70">ISOLATION OF JUGERNATH.</span></h2>


<p>Carlyle has said&mdash;“There are thirty millions of people in
Great Britain, <em>mostly fools</em>.”</p>

<p>You remind me, my friend, of the Irishman who complained
that he never served on a jury without finding
himself associated with eleven of the most obstinate pig-headed
men conceivable.</p>

<p>Are all other nations, except England, obstinate, and pig-headed?
Is the shrewd American blind to his own interest?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Are the phlegmatic Dutchman, the thrifty Belgian, the
clever Frenchman, the philosophical German, simpletons
and idiots, as Mr. Bright is pleased to call all those who do
not implicitly accept the gospel of free trade.</p>

<p>Might not Carlyle’s pithy remark teach a little humility?</p>

<p>No country except England is free-trader. Free trade,
at the present time, after a trial of thirty-eight years, is
either an English, or a barbarous custom. All other
civilized nations are obstinate protectionists; and the worst
of it is, that they are growing more and more obstinate in
their adherence to protection, as they find they are making
greater relative advance in prosperity than England with
its free trade. Even Mr. Gladstone himself admits that
“<em>America is passing us by in a canter</em>.”</p>

<p>Is not Mr. Gladstone somewhat ashamed to admit that
the country, in the government of which he has had so large
a share during the present century, should be “passed in a
canter” by a country so terribly handicapped by protection.
Does not it suggest the idea that the country which he has
governed may possibly have been misgoverned. “Passed
by at a canter!!” What a damning admission of failure!</p>

<p>His excuse is, that America is a young country with
abundant room for its surplus population; but this excuse,
like the majority of his ingenious evasions, is utterly
fictitious.</p>

<p>England, taken as a whole, with its colonies and dependencies,
is two and half times as large as America.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> She has
every advantage that America possesses.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> She had a good
start, and if she had only been governed by statesmen of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>comprehensive grasp, she ought to have outstripped America
in wealth and progress, quite as much as America has now
outstripped us.</p>

<p>If England had but carefully protected the interests of its
colonies and dependencies, studied their interests as identical
with her own, she would now have been foremost in
the race.</p>

<p>She drove America from the union with her by her selfish
policy, and she is pursuing the same, or rather far more,
suicidal policy now.</p>

<p>What is the use of the colonies? our <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Liberal politicans'">Liberal politicians</ins>
now cry. What indeed? I echo; so long as free trade
neutralizes all possible benefit to be obtained from them or
by them; but, properly governed, they would have enabled
us to do to America that which Mr. Gladstone admits
America is doing to us&mdash;“passing us by at a canter.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately we are lagging in the race with other
protectionist countries, as the following statement will show.</p>

<p>Free-traders compare our wealth and commerce with
what it was before the introduction of free trade, and claim
the increase as the result of free trade. If the claim were
just, other nations ought to have stood still, or retrograded
under protection; let us see if they have done so. The only
fair comparison is to take the condition of each country at a
given date; assuming its relative condition at that date as
100, and then comparing it with its advance at the present
time.</p>

<p>For many years England did not feel the evils of free
trade. She had a good start in the race, with the commerce
and markets of the world in her hands. She had been
foremost in improvement of machinery, having secured her
manufactures by a system of protection, and she was therefore
the first to reap the profits of such improvements. It
would naturally take years for other nations to overtake her,
when she had so good a start; but the capital she recklessly
employed in purchasing commodities which might have been
produced at home, was expended in arming foreign nations
for successful rivalry with us.</p>

<p>It was not until fifteen or twenty years ago, that this
suicidal process was sufficiently advanced to tell upon our
trade; but it is now pressing on us with alarming strides,
and had not our industries been saved, by partial suspension
of free trade, in the American and Franco-Prussian wars,
we should now feel it still more severely. As it is, we have
not seen the worst. Every day foreign industries are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
increasing in magnitude and efficiency, and consequently
must increase in cheapness of production. At present they
have done little more than take up a share from the
markets, which were formerly our own. Soon they will
invade our own country in force. In the present cotton
strike in Lancashire, the employers have given us a reason
for the terrible depression of trade, that cloth manufactures
from Belgium can now be supplied to the print-works in
Lancashire at lower rates than the Lancashire manufactured
cloth can be purchased.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>You may say the depression of trade is not confined to
England, but exists in America. I admit it, but it is very
different from that which exists in England. With America
it is the reaction of a too rapid increase of new manufacture
stimulated by successful enterprise; in the case of England
it is the steady decline of old-established industries under
crushing competition, of which we have not yet felt the
worst.</p>

<p>Mr. Syme also says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, the party of progress
has always been identified with a restrictive commercial policy,
while the conservatives are the most uncompromising of free traders.
Indeed, it may be said, that one-half of the entire English-speaking
race are, in one shape or another, in favour of a restrictionist policy,
and of this half the great majority are advanced liberals.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p></div>

<p>Free trade was an assertion on the part of labourers as
consumers; the protectionist policy of America and Australia
is the attempt of the same class to obtain privileges
as producers. The working men in those countries are
possessed by the thorough belief that, by carrying out their
policy, <em>they benefit all</em>. Free trade considered that the
interests of <em>consumers</em> suffered by protection; the Americans
and Australians, with their eyes open, undergo these private
inconveniences because they believe the <em>mass of the community
is better off thereby</em>. To use the words of an intelligent
American:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We all recognize that a protection tariff forces us to pay for
many articles slightly more than they would probably cost us
under a system of free trade. We know too that at first our manufactured
products, whether of metal, cotton or coal, cost us in
general more to make at home than they would have cost us if
imported freely from abroad. We know that we are not buying
in the cheapest market, but we believe, on the whole, it is <em>best to
impose upon ourselves the voluntary tax<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> for the great ends</em>, not
of enriching Monopolists, but of <em>promoting the best interest of the
nation</em>.”</p></div>

<p>The average American is neither a fool, nor a knave. To
fanciful theories, whose value is problematical, he prefers
the solid assurance of experience and fact.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The cause of this apparently inconsistent action on the
part of the working classes is easily explained. Free trade
was a political job,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and the working classes were enlisted,
by politicians, into a crusade against their own interests, to
assist in the overthrow of those classes which supported the
political opponents of the Free-Trading rulers.</p>

<p>For this purpose the working classes were stirred up to
class antagonism, and the Free-Traders have kept up the
delusion by dishonestly claiming as the work of free trade
every advantage which protectionist countries have shared
in common with us.</p>

<p>History is repeating itself in the delusion against which
poor old Æsop warned us centuries ago by his fable of the
“Members and the Belly.”</p>

<p>The members (manufacturing hands) hounded on by
Bright and Co. to class antagonism against the belly (the
agricultural classes) who were represented as “squandering
national wealth,” have now brought England to a pretty
pass. The reaction is taking place. Poor old Æsop was, as
a political economist, more far-seeing than Mr. Bright; who
now, however, seems to be changing his views in the most
marvellous manner, for he has at last recognised that the
manufacturing interests are affected by the agricultural
depression. For he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Home trade is bad, mainly, or entirely, because harvests have
been bad for several years. The remedy will come with more sunshine
and better yield of land, <em>without this it cannot come</em>.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>“I believe the agricultural owners and occupiers of land have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>lost more than £150,000,000 sterling through the great deficiency of
harvest.”</p></div>

<p>Bravo, Friend Bright! you are approaching the truth.
Without improvement in agricultural prosperity “the <em>remedy
for bad trade</em> cannot come.”</p>

<p>But England is not celebrated for sunshine, the <em>sunshine
we require is that of protection</em>.</p>

<p>Taking the nine years ending 1881, I find that, in only
one year, the rainfall of the United Kingdom has been
largely (7¼ inches) above the average of the last seventeen
years. In five out of the nine, the rainfall has been a little
below the average; in one year, ¼ of an inch above, and in
another year, not quite 2 inches above, the average.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the average produce of farming in
England has, of late years, been below the average of former
years; but the <em>Mark Lane Express</em> returns show that, in
all these years, there has been a considerable percentage of
cases in which the crops have been equal to or over the
average. From this we may assume that the sun is not
wholly to blame, but that want of sufficient capital to farm
properly and to recover the results of bad years has been a
very important factor in the deficiency of crops. This may
be gleaned from the replies to the questions circulated by
Mr. Bear as to the condition of the farmers in 1878.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Bedfordshire</em>:&mdash;“Farmers are losing heart, and the land is in a
much worse state than formerly.... There has been a serious
inroad upon capital account during the last few years, and the
land has seriously gone back in cultivation.... The condition
of the land has sunk.”</p>

<p><em>Cumberland</em>:&mdash;“The last season has been a good one; but the
present prices are not satisfactory, and the general depression in
trade is now having its influence on farming.”</p>

<p><em>Essex</em>:&mdash;“Farmers suffering from low prices, general depression
of trade, the rise in wages.... The work all round is carried
on languidly, and year by year the condition of the land is becoming
poorer.... A large quantity of the kind very badly farmed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Kent</em>:&mdash;“More weeds grown last year than I ever saw before.”</p>

<p><em>Monmouthshire</em>:&mdash;“Land going out of cultivation, stock reduced
in quantity, only necessary work done.”</p>

<p><em>Northamptonshire</em>:&mdash;“The results of the two last seasons will not
supply means for substantial improvements.”</p>

<p><em>Northumberland</em>:&mdash;“An immense deal of land producing nothing,
I may say, simply out of cultivation.”</p>

<p><em>Oxfordshire</em>:&mdash;“The land is very foul and poor, partly from the
continuous rains and the shortness of stock.”</p>

<p><em>Shropshire</em>:&mdash;“Very few farmers, if any, paying their way....
Hand-to-mouth farming.”</p>

<p><em>Sussex</em>:&mdash;“The land generally is not so clean or so well-cultivated
as it was a few years since.”</p></div>

<p>Lord Derby estimates that, with proper farming, we should
obtain twice as much produce as we now get.</p>

<p>I think you will admit, that if a statesman, pretending
to govern by rules of political economy, should make very
gross, misleading statements regarding the results of a
particular line of policy which he had pursued for years,
such a man must be convicted of hopeless incompetency or
else of gross dishonesty, either of which ought to disqualify
him as an administrator; and your Free Trade statesman
certainly comes under such an indictment.</p>

<p>Your Right Hon’ble Ruler rises after a public dinner, and
holds forth with matchless eloquence, pointing out the
blessings and prosperity Free Trade has brought to the
country. His statements are received with thunders of
applause, and the Right Hon’ble Orator and his audience
disperse mutually satisfied with each other.</p>

<p>I wonder whether it ever occurs to the orator, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
quiet of his chamber, that to use his own words, he “has
resorted to the simple but effectual plan of pure falsification.”<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Can he possibly be so ignorant of current events,
and of the subjects with which he ought to be acquainted, as
not to know that other nations&mdash;<em>protectionist nations</em>&mdash;<em>have
made greater relative advance</em> than ourselves; that the increase
of wealth is <em>universal</em>; that it is shared by all
civilized nations in common with us; and that it is due to
improvements in science, art, and manufacture&mdash;to improved
communications by railways, steam navigation, telegraphs,
&amp;c., which have made such enormous strides since the
date at which Free Trade was adopted. Even Mill admits
that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“So rapid had been the extension of improved processes of
agriculture, that the average price of corn had become decidedly
lower even before the repeal of the Corn Laws.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p></div>

<p>There have been short periods of temporary prosperity in
agriculture, and your Right Hon’ble Free Trader has been
jubilant in hailing them as triumphs of Free Trade; but
Adam Smith says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Improvements in manufacture tend to raise the value of land.</em><a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p></div>

<p>Dare you, my Friend, after examination of the statistics
given in the foregoing chapter, say, that the general increase
of wealth is due to Free Trade; when protectionist nations
have shared it in common with us? Aye! and taken the
lion’s share too! You claim the temporary prosperity of the
years 1871&ndash;73 as a victory for Free Trade, when in reality
this prosperity is the most damning evidence against it.
Are you so utterly blinded, as not to perceive that this
prosperity was caused by the Franco-Prussian war, which, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>preventing the unlimited importation of French and German
commodities into England, caused, in fact, partial <em>suspension
of Free Trade</em>? Don’t you know that, in those years of
prosperity, the price of wheat rose to 58<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> per quarter,
and that, in the present depressed condition of England, it
is down to 41<em>s.</em> 5<em>d.</em> per quarter? Don’t you know that,
during that time of prosperity, the excess of imports beyond
our exports was £60,000,000 less than in the present depressed
time? In other words, we were depressing our
industries by 60,000,000 sterling per annum less than at
present. Now, my Friend, give your verdict; is your Right
Hon’ble Free Trader guilty or not guilty, either of hopeless
incompetence or gross dishonesty in attributing the general
increase of wealth in the world to the agency of Free Trade?&mdash;Your
friend, Bright,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> naively admits that “to return to
protection under the name of reciprocity, is to <em>confess to the
protectionists abroad, that we have been wrong, and they have
been right</em>.” Verily! Friend Bright, whether you confess it
or not, the truth will out. Friend Bright! you are like the
ostrich, burying its head in the sand and thinking no one
can see you. The protectionist nations of Europe can see
you distinctly, and they are all laughing at your folly.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE WAGES OF JUGERNATH.</span></h2>


<p>I have not yet done with your Right Hon’ble advocate
for Free Trade.</p>

<p>I have another charge, of that which Mr. Gladstone terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the “simple and effective plan of pure falsification,” in which
he himself appears to be not an unskilful adept.</p>

<p>Your Right Hon’ble Ruler ascribes the rise of wages and
consequent prosperity to the beneficial action of Free Trade.
If this were the case, wages ought to be depressed, or at all
events stationary, in protectionist countries.</p>

<p>Let us see if this is the case:&mdash;</p>


<p class="p1 pfs90"><em>Relative rise of Wages.</em></p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="95%" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>It will be seen by this that the rise of wages has been
general; due to the general increase of wealth in civilized
nations; and that, in some cases, the relative increase has
been nearly as rapid in thirty years in the protectionist
country as it has been in forty years in England. Mill
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The labourer in America enjoys a greater abundance of comforts
than in any other country in the world, except in some of the newest
Colonies.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p></div>

<p>Is it possible to conceive a more impudent claim than
that which your Free-Trader sets up in claiming the rise of
wages as the work of Free Trade? It stands to common
sense that Free Trade, or, in other words, unlimited foreign
competition, must have a tendency to <em>reduce</em> wages. During
the agitation preceding the repeal of the Corn Laws, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
one of the arguments in favour of the movement, that cheap
bread would enable the British operative to <em>work for lower
wages</em>, and thus be able to compete with the continental
operative, who enjoyed the advantage of food at lower rates
than those obtaining in England.</p>

<p>The general rise of wages which has occurred throughout
protectionist countries, as well as in England, has been
<em>principally</em> due to the increase in the wealth of Europe; but
it has also been <em>partially due to protection</em> in the form of
Trade-unionism. For what is Trade-unionism but protection
in a somewhat extreme form?</p>

<p>The protection of <em>British labour</em> does not differ in principle
from the protection of the <em>results of British labour</em> in the
shape of its industries. Amongst the resolutions adopted at
the International Conference of Trades Unions Delegates, I
find the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are two ways of attaining the object:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Legislation for the <em>protection</em> of the weak against competition;</p>

<p>(2) Organization of workmen who should be united and disciplined
as in certain countries.”</p></div>

<p>Protection for the “<em>weak against competition</em>.” Is this in
accord with Free Trade?</p>

<span class="fs70">PAUPERISM, CRIME, AND INTEMPERANCE.</span></h2>


<p>I have still another serious charge to bring against your
Right Hon’ble Ruler, who pompously lays before you
statistics to show that, since the introduction of Free Trade,
pauperism and crime have decreased; and this your Right
Hon’ble Ruler claims as one of the results of Free Trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The figures produced seem to be all right; but really the
statistics of your Right Hon’ble Ruler have been found so
very untrustworthy, that a careful scrutiny of them is necessary;
and on investigation I find in them unmistakable evidence
of either ignorance or dishonesty.</p>

<p>These statistics show that the number of paupers under
relief in England was&mdash;</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="60%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl">In 1862</td><td class="tdr">890,000</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdr">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Apparent decrease</td><td class="tdr">91,000</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>In considering these figures, however, it must be remembered
that England has of late years greatly increased the
rate per pauper;<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> or, in other words, the relief now given
will either relieve worse cases of pauperism than before, or
else extend relief to other members of the family of the
actual recipient. The present rates of relief in England are
now four-and-half times as much as those in France, and
seven-and-half times as much as those in Belgium and
Holland.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>In the next place, your Right Hon’ble Free-Trader omits
to mention that the private charities of <em>London alone</em> (orphanages,
homes, asylums, hospitals, &amp;c.) have increased, since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>1859, by £1,159,000,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> a sum sufficient to relieve 526,000
paupers at the French rate, or nearly 900,000 by the Belgian
rate.</p>

<p>It is probable that private charities of the rest of England,
including the large provincial towns, have increased in the
same ratio as those of London; representing an enormous
amount of relief.</p>

<p>Then, again, no mention is made of the relief afforded by
Trades Unions and Benefit Societies,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> which now expend
about £4,000,000 annually in relief. This, at French rate,
represents the relief of 1,800,000 paupers, or at Belgian rate
of about 3,000,000 paupers.</p>

<p>Now, my Friend, what is your fictitious saving of 91,000
in comparison with the enormous figures given above?</p>

<p>Mr. Fawcett says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Torrens, the Member for Finsbury, sought to prove that
pauperism was increasing, that vast numbers of able-bodied labourers
were unemployed, and that the normal condition of a considerable
proportion of our population was one of abject misery and deplorable
destitution.</p>

<p>“Mr. Goschen met these statements by a positive and indignant
denial. He quoted a number of statistics to prove that the iron
trade, the cotton trade, and other important branches of industry
were reviving; he was jubilant over the fact that the number of
paupers had only increased by 10,000 in a twelvemonth, and he
became quite elated when recounting that the working classes were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>using more tea and sugar, and that their average consumption of
beer and spirits was augmenting. The speech was loudly applauded,
especially by the commercial members. There are many who still
think that the well-doing of a country can be measured by its
exports and imports.... It is not our intention to dispute the
accuracy of Mr. Goschen’s statistics. There is, however, too much
reason to fear that they only tell a small part of the truth; and
that, if not judiciously considered, they may conceal awkward and
ugly facts which it will be perilous to ignore.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>“Sir Edward Sullivan alluded to a statement made, he said, by a
distinguished statesman, that, out of a population of thirty-four
millions seven millions were <em>toeing the line of starvation</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p></div>

<p>And these statements would appear to be in accord with
the figures I have given above.</p>

<p>The statistics of your Right Hon’ble Ruler, which you
receive with thunders of applause, are not worth the paper
on which they are written.</p>

<p>Again I ask your verdict&mdash;guilty or not guilty?</p>

<p>Now for Crime. The statistics in this case are less
defensible than in the previous case, because they involve a
dishonourable <em>suppression of facts</em>.</p>

<p>The statistics brought forward to show that a diminution
of crime has been the result of Free Trade, are as follows:</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="60%" summary="">

<p>Now this <em>apparent</em> decrease is wholly due to the “Criminal
Justice Act” of 1855, which enables Magistrates to
pass short sentences; and these, coming under the head of
“Summary Convictions,” do not appear under the head of
“Convictions,” <em>where they would have appeared but for the
“Act” of 1855</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>If we take the total cases, <em>including summary convictions</em>,
the figures stand as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In other words, instead of your Right Hon’ble Ruler’s
decrease of 2,000 convictions, we have actually an increase
of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'nearly 3,000,000'">nearly 300,000</ins>. Is it possible to conceive a more
glaring case of what Mr. Gladstone himself terms “the
simple but effectual plan of <em>pure falsification</em>?”</p>

<p>Now for Intemperance. The number of persons fined for
drunkenness in England:</p>

<p class="noindent">or roughly speaking, the convictions for drunkenness have
doubled in twenty-one years.</p>

<p>Truly, my Friend, you cannot congratulate Free Trade
on the decrease of pauperism, crime, and intemperance it
has produced.</p>

<span class="fs70">JUGERNATH AFLOAT.</span></h2>


<p>I see, my Friend, that you are bringing out your trump
card. “Behold!” you argue “the unfortunate condition to
which America has been reduced by her protectionist policy;
she has scarcely a ship afloat, whilst Free Trade England is
carrying the commerce of the world.”</p>

<p>First, I would ask, are you <em>quite</em> sure that all this is
caused by Free Trade?</p>

<p>Don’t you think that it is just within the bounds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
possibility that our shrewd American cousins may possibly
find a quicker and more remunerative investment for their
capital, in encouraging their home-productive industries,
and in employing their home-labour productively, than in a
keen competition with the English for a barren trade that is
not worth having?</p>

<p>Are you ignorant of the fact that the shipping trade has
been a losing concern for some considerable period?</p>

<p>Are you unaware of the fact that wheat has been frequently
carried as ballast, and has paid no freight; that other
articles have been carried at almost nominal rates?</p>

<p>In the <cite>Civil and Military Gazette</cite> of 7th December, 1883,
under the Telegraphic Summary, I read&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is predicted that, unless freight rates to India speedily improve,
a considerable number of steamers now engaged in the trade
will be laid up.”</p></div>

<p>I also read in the <cite>Madras Mail</cite>, January 9th, 1884, that
an organ of the shipping interests in London has drawn up
the probable “results of the gross working of thirteen steamers
of a well-known Steam Navigation Company, the result
of which is a total loss of £34,000 in one year’s trading.”</p>

<p>Are the Americans to be pitied, because they have no
share in this losing concern?</p>

<p>If protectionism has kept them out of it, you can scarcely
blame it.</p>

<p>But even without such keen competition, the Americans
are justified, by the writings of your sacred shastras, as may
be seen by the following quotation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The capital, therefore, employed in the <em>Home trade</em> of any
country will generally give encouragement and support to a greater
quantity of productive labour in that country, and increase the
value of its annual produce, more than an equal capital employed in
the <em>Foreign trade</em> of consumption; and the capital employed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
this latter trade has, in both these respects, a <em>still greater advantage
over an equal capital engaged in the Carrying trade</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p></div>

<p>So you see that the authority of your own sacred writings
is favourable to the policy of our American cousins in this
respect.</p>

<span class="fs70">ADVERSE PROSPERITY.</span></h2>


<p>I have a few words to say about high wages and prosperity,
before I quit the subject.</p>

<p>Although the rise of wages is, in fact, to some extent, the
work of protection, I am not proud of it; for trades unionism
is protection of an extreme character, generally narrow
in its aims, not sufficiently far-seeing, and consequently
sometimes mischievous in its results.</p>

<p>The raising of wages within reasonable bounds is desirable;
but, in a Free Trade country, it is apt to be attended
with serious consequences in raising the cost of the manufactured
article, when competing against the manufacture
of foreign countries, where wages are lower and hours of
work longer.</p>

<p>It is said by Free Trade advocates, that although the cost
of provisions has not sensibly increased, yet <em>wages are 50 per
cent. higher, and hours of labour 20 per cent. less</em>, than they
were forty years ago.</p>

<p>From the political economist’s point of view, this appears
to be a decrease of national wealth. Mill says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Saving enriches, and spending impoverishes, the community
along with the individual. Society at large is richer by what it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
expends in <em>maintaining and aiding productive labour</em>, but poorer by
what it expends in its enjoyments.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p></div>

<p>Now if a stalwart race could have existed, and have done
20 per cent. more work on the lower rate of wages,&mdash;although,
doubtless, some improvement in the condition of
workmen was desirable,&mdash;50 per cent. appears to be a large
margin, when we consider that the price of provisions is said
to be unaltered. The British workman is proverbially
extravagant and improvident. High wages encourage extravagance,
whilst surplus cash furnishes the means, and
short hours the leisure, for gratifying a taste for drink.</p>

<p>Setting aside for the moment the serious evils of intemperance,
we have practically, with high wages, the causes that
lead to the impoverishment of a community.</p>

<p>A glance at the statistics of Mr. Giffen seems to indicate
this, for whilst the consumption per head of those commodities
which are termed necessaries of life, have only increased
33 to 40 per cent. respectively, the consumption of those
which may be considered luxuries&mdash;namely, tea and sugar&mdash;have
increased 232 and 260 per cent. respectively.</p>

<p>Again, statistics show that, whilst the other classes of the
community have increased in number by 335 per cent. of
late years, the working classes have only increased by 6½
per cent. In other words, the unproductive classes have
increased largely, but, whilst there is only 6½ per cent.
<em>numerical</em> increase in the productive classes, their labour has
decreased by 20 per cent. from shorter hours of labour.</p>

<p>The drones in the hive have increased very largely, and
the workers have not done so, but have developed an alarming
taste for honey.</p>

<p>The question of waste of wealth would be comparatively
of minor importance were it not seriously complicated by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
existence of Free Trade; but we have now to confront the
fact, that, in the present day, we have to pay 50 per cent.
more money for 20 per cent. less labour than we did forty
years ago; whilst Free Trade brings into the market the
products of the keen competition of a thrifty and parsimonious
class of workmen who accept lower wages and work
longer hours. The result must be a gradual extinction of
our industries:</p>

<p>Cotton and woollen industries are struggling hard for
existence.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Silk manufacture is dying out.</p>

<p>Iron industries in a bad way.</p>

<p>Gloomy predictions are made respecting the shipping
trade.</p>

<p>Agriculture is rapidly becoming extinguished.</p>

<p>English pluck, capital, and credit are struggling manfully
against disaster, but the struggle cannot last much
longer; capital is sustained by credit; and credit is
receiving heavy and repeated blows from unremunerative
industries. Meanwhile, high wages and extravagant habits
are not the best training for the millions that will be thrown
out of employment when the crash comes.</p>

<p>Your prophet, Adam Smith, though an advocate for the
repeal of the Corn Laws, foresaw and forewarned you of these
consequences, as follows:&mdash;</p>

says:
</p>
<p>
“We were promised cheaper Government, cheaper food, greater prosperity.
We find that so far from these promises being verified, they have
every one been falsified by the result.
</p>
<p>
“Our Imperial Government is dearer by £8,000,000; our Imperial and
Local Government, together, is dearer by £10,000,000.

3<em>d.</em> to 5<em>d.</em> per stone; Mutton, by 1<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em>; money is dearer than 1¾ per cent.
</p>
<p>
“As to prosperity, our staple pig iron is cheaper by 22<em>s.</em> 2<em>d.</em> per ton.

crops; 50,077 fewer horses; 129,119 fewer cattle; 4,789,738 fewer sheep
in the country. We have, in spite of the Land Act and the allegation of
increased prosperity, 18,828 more paupers in Ireland on a decreasing population.
We find that 115,092 more emigrants have left the country in a
year, because they cannot get a living in it. We lose annually 349 more
vessels and 1,534 more lives at sea. The only element of consolation that
these figures” (Board of Trade Returns) “have to show is, that we have
778,389 more pigs and 4,627 more policemen in the country. In fact, we
are more lacking in every thing we want; more abounding in every thing
we don’t want.
</p>
<p>
“The price of everything we have to sell has gone down; the price of
everything we have to buy has gone up; and what has gone up most is
the price of Government.
</p>
<p>
“Dearer Government, dearer bread, dearer beef, dearer mutton, dearer
money; cheaper pig iron; less corn, potatoes, turnips, grass, and hops,
fewer horses, fewer cattle, fewer sheep; more paupers, more emigrants,
more losses of life and property at sea, more pigs, more policemen.

<span class="fs70">SACRED RIGHTS OF PROPERTY.</span></h2>


<p>I have already stated that Mill, when he allows that which
Herbert Spencer terms “political bias,”&mdash;and Luigi Cossa
terms his “<em>narrow philosophic utilitarianism</em>,” to warp his
better judgment,&mdash;is guilty of absurdities and inconsistencies
that would disgrace a schoolboy. This is notably apparent
when he attempts to draw a fundamental distinction between
land and any other property, as regards its “sacred rights.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mill greatly admired the prosperity of the peasant
proprietors in France and Belgium, unfortunately forgetting
that a system, suited to the sober thrifty peasantry of the
Continent, might possibly not be equally suitable to the
improvident lower classes of Ireland and England,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> neglectful
also of the sensible view taken by <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'M. DeLavergne'">M. De Lavergne</ins> that
“<em>cultivation spontaneously finds out the organization that suits
it best</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> He wished therefore to establish an Utopia of
peasant proprietors in England and Ireland as a panacea for
the evils which Free Trade in the first place, and mischievous
legislation in the second place, had brought upon agriculture.
Without presuming to offer an opinion on the
debated subjects of “Grande” and “Petite Culture,” or
peasant and landlord proprietorship, I may say that cultivation
appears to have found out spontaneously the organization
best suited to it, and that, in England and Ireland, landlordism
seems best suited to the improvident character of
the lower classes, in providing capital to help the tenants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>over bad times, and enabling improvements to be made in
prosperous times.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, peasant proprietorship has proved to
be a failure in Ireland, and is rapidly becoming extinct.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Writers on the subject state that, under that system, labour
was so ill-directed, that it required six men to provide food
for ten; and consolidation of holdings is recommended. Mr.
Mill, however, thought otherwise, and biased by this political
conviction, he has propounded the following extraordinary
arguments to prove that the sacred rights of property are
not applicable in the case of landed property<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blocka">

<p>(1) “No man made the land.”</p>

<p>(2) It is the original inheritance of the whole species.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>(3) Its appropriation is wholly a question of general expediency.</p>

<p>(4) When private property in land is not expedient, it is unjust.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>

<p>(5) It is no hardship to any one to be excluded from what
others have produced.</p>

<p>(6) But it is a hardship to be born into the world and to
find all nature’s gifts previously engrossed.</p>

<p>(7) Whoever owns land, keeps others out of the enjoyment of it.</p>
</div>

<p>Now let us apply Mr. Mill’s arguments to any other kind
of property.</p>

<p>Suppose I say to you:&mdash;“My friend! you have two coats;
hand one of them over to me! Sacred rights of property
don’t apply to it; you did not make it; and Mill says&mdash;‘<em>it
is no hardship to be excluded from what others have produced</em>;’
but it is some hardship to be born into the world, and to find
all nature’s gifts engrossed. Your argument that you paid
for it in hard cash is worthless. <em>No man made</em> silver and
gold, ‘it is the original inheritance of the whole species, the
receiver is as bad as the thief, and you have connived in the
robbery of those metals from the earth, leaving posterity yet
unborn to be under the hardship of finding all nature’s gifts
engrossed.’</p>

<p>“The manufacture of your coat is based on robbery and
injustice, and you have connived at it; the iron and coal
used in its production were <em>made by no man</em>, they are the
<em>common inheritance of the species</em>, those who have obtained
them have robbed posterity. You have bribed them to do
so by silver and gold, also robbed from posterity.</p>

<p>“The very wool of which your coat is formed was <em>made by
no man</em>, it was robbed from a defenceless sheep. Your argument
that the sheep was the property of the shearer is
useless. No man made the sheep, it is the common
inheritance of all, &amp;c. Your argument that his owner
reared the sheep, is equally worthless. Monster! if you
find a child, have you a right to rob him and make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
slave of him? such an argument would justify slavery<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> or
worse.</p>

<p>“When <em>private property is not expedient it is unjust</em>, and
from my ground of view, it is not expedient that this private
property should be yours; public only differs from private
expediency in degree. ‘He who owns property keeps others
out of the enjoyment of it,’ the sacred rights of property
don’t apply to this coat; so hand it over without any more
of your absurd arguments. Nay! if you don’t, and as I see
some one is approaching who may interfere, its appropriation
is one of expediency,&mdash;individual expediency must
follow the same law as general expediency,&mdash;it is expedient
that I should draw my knife across your throat, otherwise I
shall lose that which is my inheritance in common with the
rest of the species.” And so I might argue <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Mill’s sophisms however are, what Cossa terms, “concessions
more apparent than real to socialism,” for further
on, in his Political Economy, he completely stultifies his
argument by stating that the principle of property gives to
the landowners:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“a right to compensation for whatever portion of their interest
in the land it may be the policy of the State to deprive them of.
To that <em>their claim is indefeasible</em>. It is due to landowners, and
to owners of any property whatever recognised as such by the State,
that they should not be dispossessed of it without receiving its
pecuniary value.... This is due on the <em>general principles on which
property rests</em>. If the land was bought with the produce of the
labour and abstinence of themselves or their ancestors, compensation
is due to them on that ground; <em>even if otherwise</em>, it is still due on
the ground of prescription.”</p>

<p>“Nor,” he adds, “can it ever be necessary for accomplishing an
object by which the community altogether will gain, that a particular

<p>Unfortunately, however, his mischievous denial of the
sacred rights of property in land is eagerly read, while
his subsequent qualification of it is neglected by those who,
like Mr. Bright, aim at the destruction of a political
opponent; or, like Mr. Gladstone, are bent on a particular
policy, reckless of the results in carrying it out; or, like Mr.
Parnell and his followers, whose hands itch for plunder; and
it has produced a general haziness of ideas amongst that
well-meaning class of people who are good-naturedly liberal
with the property of other people.</p>

<p>Yet, clothe it with what sophism you will, any attempt,
whether legalized or otherwise, to deprive the landowner of
his property and to violate his rights, is as unjustifiable as
the depredations of the burglar or the pickpocket. Nay
more so; because the statesman or political economist cannot
plead poverty or want of education as his excuse.</p>

<p>You will probably, attempt to discredit your sacred
writings when they do not support your own views.</p>

<p>You will argue that Adam Smith wrote when the conditions
of society and commerce were very different from
what they are now.</p>

<p>Mathematicians say, that when a formula will not accommodate
itself to altering conditions and circumstances, it is
unsound. It is the same with political science. Either the
political science of Adam Smith is unsound, and he is not
reliable, or the serious indictments against Free Trade given
in the quotations above are well-founded.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE VAMPIRE.</span></h2>


<p>What is the nature of a country-life that it should breed
such a vampire,&mdash;such a monster of iniquity,&mdash;such a
“squanderer of national wealth” as the landlord whom your
Free-trading friends hold up to public execration? The old
classical idea “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">procul a negotiis</span>” would indicate that it had
a contrary influence. How is it then that it produces the
unmitigated miscreant whom Bright delights to denounce,&mdash;whom
Gladstone loves to pursue with ruinous enactments,&mdash;and
whom Parnell, with his murderous crew, takes pleasure
in “boycotting,” maiming, and assassinating? The external
appearance of this monster gives no clue to his character.
From personal acquaintance with men of this class in
England I should have said, that, on the average, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
well-meaning, harmless, good-natured men; not always of
the widest of views, or shrewdest intelligence, but with the
best intentions, anxious in bad times to help their tenants,
and in good times to improve their property. Even your
prophet Adam Smith appears to have been deceived by
them.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Again, appearances are deceptive; for, to my
inexperienced eye, there seemed to be a large amount of
kindly sympathy between tenant and landlord.</p>

<p>I am unable to speak from personal experience respecting
the same classes in Ireland; but all novels and tales of Irish
life, which should reflect, with some degree of truth, the
general aspect of things, agree in describing scenes, probably
founded on facts, from which one would imagine that, before
the present agitation and enactments, there appeared to
exist much kindly feeling and sympathy between the
peasantry and the “Masther,” who, with all his faults, is
represented as a generous, rollicking, devil-may-care sort of
fellow,<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> quite opposed to the grasping, grinding miscreant
whom your friends denounce; of course, there were exceptions.</p>

<p>Mr. A. M. Sullivan seems also to have been mistaken when
he says:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The conduct of the Irish landlords throughout the famine
period has been variously described, and has, I believe, been
generally condemned. I consider the censure visited on them too
sweeping. I hold it to be in some respects <em>cruelly unjust</em>....
It is impossible to contest authentic cases of brutal heartlessness
here and there; but granting all that has to be entered on the dark
debtor side, the overwhelming balance is the other way. The bulk
of the resident Irish landlords manfully did their best in that dread
hour. If they did too little compared with what the landlord class
in England would have done in a similar case, it was because little
was in their power.... They were heritors of estates
heavily overweighted with the debts of a bygone generation....
To these landowners the failure of one year’s rental
receipts meant mortgage, foreclosure, and hopeless ruin. Yet cases
might be named by the score in which men <em>scorned to avert</em>, by
pressure on their suffering tenancy, <em>the fate they saw impending over
them</em>. They went down with the ship.</p>

<p>“No adequate tribute has ever been paid to the memory of those
Irish landlords, and they were men of every party and creed, who
perished martyrs to duty, in that awful time.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p></div>

<p>It is wonderful how, at such an awful time, the Irish landlord
should have continued to mask his true character.</p>

<p>Still I am rather puzzled.</p>

<p>I quite admit that the Irish landlord is wrong in rack-renting
his tenant to the extent of grinding out of him one-third
of the amount that is cheerfully paid by tenants in
<em>protectionist</em> countries.</p>

<p>I admit that he should not have tried in a <em>Free Trade country</em>
to have extorted more than one-tenth of the rent paid
by protectionist tenants. Nay, I will go further. I don’t
think that a tenant in Free Trade Ireland would farm to a
profit even if he had the land <em>rent-free</em>. I admit also that it
was selfish of the landlord to allow the question of his own
pauperism to weigh in the question of rent.</p>

<p>Still, after making due allowance for all these faults, I
cannot quite understand how his guilt is sufficiently proven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to warrant his continued persecution and gradual extermination,
by enactment after enactment for his ruin, should he
chance to escape assassination. A snake or a rat could not
be hunted down with greater venom. I must say that, in
spite of his crimes, he is an object of pity.</p>

<p>Perhaps an analysis of his villainy may help me to understand
the heinousness of his crime; let us apply, therefore,
to the political economist for the character of the rent, the
instrument with which he commits his crime&mdash;what does he
say?<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Rent does not affect the price of agricultural produce.”<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>“Whoever does pay rent gets back its full value in extra advantage,
and the rent which he pays does not place him in a worse
position than, but only in the same position as, his fellow-producer
who pays no rent, but whose instrument is one of inferior efficiency.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>“Rent is reached by bargaining between the landlord and tenant;
bargaining founded on the practical elements existing in the business.
Profit must satisfy the tenant, or he will not take the farm;
and on the other hand, if he claim an unduly low rent, he will find
a rival competitor stepping into the farm house.... The
position of an in-coming tenant is that of a man who is buying a
business for sale (for whether he purchases the farm outright in
order to cultivate it, or hires it, makes no difference in the nature of
the transaction). He is buying a specific business in a given
locality, as any man might do in a manufacturing town, and his
motive is <em>profit</em>. This consideration governs the whole of the
negotiation between the landowner and himself ... upon
the terms of an annual payment of the means of <em>profit</em> which he
seeks to acquire.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p></div>

<p>Yes! This appears to me to be just and business-like; the
tenant hires the land for the profit he expects to get out of
it, and his rent is a simple debt. Proceed:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To refuse to pay debt violently is to <em>steal</em>, and to permit stealing
is not only to dissolve, but to demoralize, society.”[70]</p>

<p>“When a portion of wealth passes out of the hands of him who
has acquired it, without his consent, and without compensation, to
him who has not created it ... plunder is perpetrated.”[71]</p>

<p>“Law is common force organized to prevent injustice.”[71]</p>

<p>“If the law itself performs the action it ought to repress, plunder
is still perpetrated under aggravated circumstances.”[71]</p>

<p>“To place the position itself of a landlord in an invidious light,
as a man who exacts from the labours of others that for which he
has neither toiled nor spun, is a most unwarrantable process of argumentation.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>“It would be impossible to introduce into society a greater change
and a greater evil than this:&mdash;the conversion of law into an instrument
of plunder.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p></div>

<p>Yes, yes! All this appears to me to be just and sensible!
but pardon me, I am a little obtuse. I cannot yet see that
the landlord’s guilt is proven. Let us recapitulate:&mdash;</p>

<p>Rent does not raise the price of corn! The tenant gets
value for his rent! He enters into a business contract for
profit! The rent is a simple debt. To refuse it, is to steal!
To assist legally at this refusal, is to be an accomplice in the
theft! In this case Government is the accomplice, and the
Government is a plunderer under aggravated circumstances!
Moreover, it not only plunders, but demoralizes society. Mr.
Gladstone represents Government. Messrs. Bright, Parnell,
Davitt and Co. assist in this legalized and illegal plunder;
thus demoralizing the society. The property of the landlord
passes to another <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'without his cousent'">without his consent</ins> and without
compensation! Messrs. Gladstone and Co. use that which
Professor Bonamy Price terms a most “unwarrantable process
of argumentation.”</p>

<p>Stop! Stop!! for goodness’ sake!!! My brain is getting
confused; in my innocence, had I not been gravely assured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>that they were angels of light, patriots, philanthropists,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> I

<p>Your friend, John Bright, with his usual disregard for
accuracy, describes the large landlord as the “squanderer
and absorber of national wealth,” but seeing that the total
rent of land in Great Britain and Ireland is less than 5 per
cent. of the whole national income,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and that of this less
than one-seventh is in the hands of large landowners, it
would require a more able statesman than Mr. Bright to
show how he can squander that, of which such a very small
proportion passes through his lands.</p>

<p>No? friend Bright. You and your fellow free-traders are
the real squanderers of national wealth, and you seek to
shift the blame from your own shoulders, by dishonestly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>laying it on those of the landowner. I command to your
perusal the graphic description of a large landowner&mdash;the
Duke of Argyle&mdash;who states that, in Trylee, by feeding the
tenantry in bad times, by assisting some to emigrate, by
introducing new methods of cultivation, by expenditure of
capital in improvements, by consolidating small holdings
when too narrow for subsistence, he has raised a community,
from the lowest state of poverty and degradation, to one of
lucrative industry and prosperity.</p>

<p>The prosperity these tenants enjoy is due to the beneficial
and regulative power of the landlord as a capitalist. The
greater the wealth of the landlord, the greater is his
beneficial and regulative power. There were thousands of
landowners who acted up to the limits of their power in
this way, until you, friend Bright, ruined them and deprived
them of the power of helping their tenants.</p>

<p>No, doubt, there are bad landlords, as there are bad men
in all classes, but the interests of the landowner and those
of the tenant are inseparably bound together; and the landlord
is shrewd enough to see that it is to his own interest to
improve the property if he can afford to do so.</p>

<p>The old classic, with his insight into human nature, in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">odimus quos læsimus</i>, shows that human nature has not
altered, and it does not surprise me that you should hold up
to execration the class you have so cruelly injured.</p>

<p>You, my Free-trading Fanatic, have (thanks to Mill’s
unfortunate sophisms and your leaders’ persistent misrepresentations)
such a very hazy view about landowner’s rights
and duties, that I think a few words on the subject may
clear the atmosphere.</p>

<div class="blocka fs80">

<p>(1.) Landed property is the capital of the landlord.</p>

<p>(2.) Interest on capital is fair, reasonable, and consistent with
general good.</p>

<p>(3.) Rent is interest on the capital of the landlord.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>(4.) The landlord may sell<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> his land, invest the proceeds in any
other way, and thus get interest on his capital.</p>

<p>(5.) The tenant can get rid of rent, either:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="blocka fs80 pad2">

<p>(a) by borrowing money to buy land, in which case he has
to pay interest on the loan;</p>

<p>(b) by saving sufficient money to purchase land, in which
case he might, instead of purchasing, invest the
money, so that its interest would pay the rent.</p></div>

<div class="blocka fs80">

<p>(6.) In any case the whole question of rent resolves itself into
a question of capital, and interest thereon.</p>

<p>(7.) Law, from time immemorial, has recognised the right of
property in land.</p>

<p>(8.) In most cases the owner has paid hard cash both for the
land and for the improvements of it.</p>

<p>(9.) Land is therefore actual capital just as much as money, coal,
iron, cattle, or any other disposable commodity.</p></div>

<p>It is absurd, therefore, to say, that a man possessing
capital in land may not act in the same way as the owner of
any other form of capital. (Of course he has his moral
obligations, but those are applicable to the possession of any
other form of capital.) If the tenant desires capital, he
must work for it, or obtain it in some legal manner. If he
get it in any other way, it is theft; and any legislation that
transfers the capital of the landlord to the tenant without
due compensation, is legalized theft.</p>

<p>As regards absentee landlords, I admit it is desirable, on
many grounds&mdash;on the ground of his own personal interest&mdash;to
put it on the lowest ground, that he should not be
absent; but if the life of the landlord and his family be at
stake, is he to be blamed if he declines to take the risk of
being boycotted or shot? You argue that <em>he does nothing
for his money which he draws, and spends away from the
place in which it has been produced</em>, thus impoverishing the
district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Is he different in this respect from the capitalist who
invests money in colonial or foreign funds, who does nothing
for his money, and spends it away from the country in which
it is produced? Is he different in this respect from the
London banker, who lends money to the manufacturer in the
provinces, or abroad? He does nothing for his money, but
spends it away from the locality in which it has been produced.
Would you argue on this ground, that the railway
shareholder, the foreign bondholder, the London banker
ought, in equity, to receive no interest on their money, and
should be held up to public execration? If you place any
value on the laws of political economy, which you are so
fond of quoting, my Fanatical Friend, drop your absurd
arguments about landlords. Land is a commodity to be
bought, sold, improved by the capital of the landlord, and if
you treat it otherwise, you violate every principle of sound
political economy.</p>

<p>Admitting that land is capital, and the landlord is the
capitalist, what does Political Economy say?&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If a man has not wealth himself, but only his labour to sell,
what is most to his advantage? Why, of course, that there should
be as many rich men as possible to compete for his labour....
Nothing can be more fatal than the <em>cry against capital</em> so often
unthinkingly uttered.... It would be impossible to conceive
a <em>greater benefactor to his country</em> than the one who would
permanently reconcile the interests of masters and workmen, and
<em>put an end to the internecine wars of capital and labour</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p></div>

<p>Verily! Friend Bright, the cry against the landlord is a
“<em>cry against capital unthinkingly uttered</em>.” Verily thou
encouragest the “<em>internecine wars of capital and labour</em>.”
Verily thou art the reverse of a benefactor to thy country.</p>

<p>The verdict of Political Economy condemns thee!!</p>

<span class="fs70">PROSPEROUS ADVERSITY.</span></h2>


<p>One conclusion at which the Commission of 1882 arrived
was, that the agricultural labourers were “never in a better
position.” When, however, we analyze the evidence on
which that conclusion was based, the case wears a very
different aspect. The evidence of landlords, agents, and
factors,&mdash;of those who have to pay the wages out of their
struggle to make both ends meet,&mdash;is to the effect that
the labourer is well enough off; but the evidence of the
labourer himself&mdash;the recipient&mdash;gives rather a different
version of the case. It is true that wages are higher than
they were formerly: this naturally must follow the increase
of wages in manufacturing districts; but the evidence of the
labourer shows that these wages are insufficient to keep a
family, or provide for bodily wants, to say nothing of sickness
or loss of work; perquisites are being gradually taken
away, and no compensation given; families are suffering
severely; physique degenerating for want of sufficient food;
articles of diet, such as cheese, bacon, eggs are much more
expensive than before; the supply of milk, and especially of
skimmed milk, formerly so plentiful and obtainable at
nominal prices, is now at prohibitory rates. Water, with a
little bread, sweetened with sugar, forms the general substitute
for wholesome milk in rearing children.</p>

<p>The recent census shows that although the population of
England has increased 14½ per cent., there has been, in the
purely agricultural districts, a decrease in the population,&mdash;a
sure sign of want of prosperity. In all parts farms are
badly cultivated, in a foul condition, or out of cultivation
altogether; neither the landlord nor the tenant, have sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
capital to make improvements.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> A clergyman writes
from a rural parish:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I fear nothing will lessen the evil, the land of England will
gradually go out of cultivation, and our villages will become impoverished
and empty till the country is all urban, and the population
effeminate and demoralized. Then may follow a great war,
and disaster will ensue.”</p></div>

<p>Emerson warned England of the fact that her&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Robust rural Saxon population had degenerated, in the mills, to
the Leicester stockinger, and to the imbecile Manchester spinner far

<p>Why did a handful of undisciplined Boers beat our
soldiers in the Transvaal? Simply because they are physically

for recruiting purposes.</p>

<span class="fs70">IRELAND UNDER THE WHEELS.</span></h2>


<p>I repeat the assertion that Ireland has been <em>ruined by Free
Trade</em>.</p>

<p>Let us take a brief retrospect of Ireland before the introduction
of Free Trade.</p>

<p>At the earlier part of this century Ireland showed great
capabilities for improvement and national prosperity, and
(in spite of the somewhat selfish policy of England, which
did not sufficiently protect from herself the industries of
Ireland) she gave undoubted signs of a steady but rapid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>advance in prosperity. Between the years 1825 and 1835,
her exports and imports were more than doubled.</p>

<p>Her population between 1821 and 1841 increased from
6,802,000 to 8,196,000. That this population was not too
great for the land, is proved by the fact that the whole
resources of land were not utilized; moreover, her population
was far smaller per square mile than the population of
Holland or Belgium<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>&mdash;countries that enjoy a high state of
prosperity. In the years of 1826 and 1835, the ratio of exports
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center fs80">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdr wd5">1826.</td><td class="tdr wd5"></td><td class="tdr wd5">1835.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Oxen</td><td class="tdr">1·0</td><td class="tdr">to</td><td class="tdr">1·7</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Pigs</td><td class="tdr">1·0</td><td class="tdr">”</td><td class="tdr">5·1</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Wheat, oats, &amp;c.</td><td class="tdr">1·0</td><td class="tdr">”</td><td class="tdr">1·9</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The county cess rose between 1825 and 1838 in the ratio
of 1·0 to 1·5.</p>

<p>The transfers of invested funds from England to Ireland
between the years 1832 and 1841 exceeded those from Ireland,
to England by £1,840,000.</p>

<p>Deposits in savings banks, in 1831 and 1841, were relatively
in the proportion of 1·00 to 2·24. Crime and offences
were diminishing.</p>

<p>The Weavers Commission in 1840 reported as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The comparative prosperity enjoyed by that part of Ireland
where tranquillity ordinarily prevails.&mdash;such as the Counties Down,
Antrim, and Derry,&mdash;testify the <em>capabilities of Ireland to work out
her own regeneration</em>, when freed of the disturbing causes which
have so long impeded her progress in civilization and improvement.</p>

<p>“We find there a population hardy, healthy, and <em>employed</em>;
capital fast flowing into this district; new sources of employment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
daily developing themselves; and people well disposed alike to
Government and to the institutions of the country, and not distrustful
and jealous of their superiors.”</p></div>

<p>In another place the Commission reports that the manufacturing
industries of Ireland were doing well, and that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The woollen trade in Ireland is in a more sound and healthy
condition than it has ever been, and its yearly advance may be
confidently expected.”</p></div>

<p>There was an abundant supply of land for the increasing
population&mdash;1,200,000 acres of land being capable of cultivation,
besides upwards of 1,000,000 acres of bog land
capable of reclamation at a cost of little more than £1 per
acre.</p>

<p>With such capabilities for advancement, nothing short of
the most extraordinary prosperity ought to have followed
the general advance of wealth in the civilised world, caused
by the improvements in arts, sciences, machinery, steam,
and electricity. But what do we find after thirty-six years
of the curse of Free Trade? Land out of cultivation; farms
abandoned; manufacturing industries extinct; population
decreasing by more than three millions<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> in forty years.
Anarchy, murder, assassination rampant. No doubt the
Famine of 1847 and the subsequent emigration caused a
large decrease in the population of Ireland, but disciples of
the Malthusian theory would have told you that this was an
element of prosperity. I do not hold this view, but any
protectionist country would have rapidly recovered the blow,
whilst Free Trade Ireland has since steadily decreased in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
population, and is sinking lower and lower into the Slough of
Despond.</p>

<p>You argue that “<em>rack-renting is the cause</em>.” Nonsense!
The average rent of land in Ireland is only one-third of that
which is paid in prosperous protectionist countries;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> any
rent at all will soon be a rack-rent. There is plenty of land
in Ireland to be had at nominal rents, land that has gone
out of cultivation; but Free Trade has taken away the
possibility of its cultivation at a profit, even if it were rent-free.
You urge absenteeism as the cause; it is the <em>effect</em>, not
the cause. Moreover, only about one-sixth of the land is
owned by absentees.</p>

<p>Ireland is like a child crying out in the pangs of starvation,
and you give it opiates in the shape of mischievous
enactments (such as the Encumbered Estates Act and the Land
Act) which only augment the evil. To use the words of a
writer of the day: “<em>Your Statesmanship knows no policy but
that of coercion to-day, concession to-morrow</em>.” Ireland cries
in the pangs of hunger, you alternately beat and coax it.</p>

<p>You propose wholesale emigration, which may be compared
to bleeding the patient to death in order to cure it of
starvation.</p>

<p><em>Fools!!</em> Can’t you see it is dying of hunger? All it
wants is food, work, and employment of its labour,&mdash;development
of its resources.</p>

<p>Take away your iniquitous policy of Free Trade,&mdash;abolish
your unjust enactments, your legalised instruments of confiscation
and plunder,&mdash;abandon your insane encouragement of
internecine war between capital and labour,&mdash;desist from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
your suicidal encouragement to agitation and class antagonism,&mdash;encourage
capitalists,&mdash;protect industries,&mdash;employ
labour,&mdash;and you will soon find Ireland prosperous, contented,
and loyal.</p>

<p>The cry for Home Rule is a protest against your misrule.</p>

<p>If you persist in your insane policy, Ireland must inevitably
be depopulated either by starvation or by wholesale
emigration.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<span class="fs70">THE FINISHING STROKE.</span></h2>


<p>I have not the slightest doubt, that you will tell me that
Ireland is <em>not ruined</em>, that she was never before in so satisfactory
condition, and that you will bring forward ingeniously
manipulated statistics to prove your case.</p>

<p>You will tell me that the farms are larger,&mdash;that the farm
stock is richer,&mdash;that the peasant proprietors who were a
failure (contrary to Mr. Mill’s theories) are disappearing, and
holdings are more consolidated; but, my Fanatical Friend,
if Ireland be not ruined, what is the meaning of this frantic
legislation, which many of its supporters can only excuse on
the ground of expediency, not equity? How is it that,
during the last thirty-two years, nearly 1,500,000 acres have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
gone out of tillage and 677,000 acres have gone out of farming
altogether?</p>

<p>How is it that, during the last nine years, there has been
a decrease of 1,000,000<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> live stock in Ireland, or nearly
one-ninth of the total?</p>

<p>How is it that, during one year, 114,327<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> acres of land in
Ireland have gone out of farming, and that with a decreasing
population, and that in spite of a better crop in 1880
than in 1879?</p>

<p>What is the meaning of the increase of 18,000 paupers
and 115,000 emigrants in Ireland within the last three
years?</p>

<p>Mill would have told you that the extinction of peasant
proprietors was a sign of retrogression; whether that be so
or not, the crushing out of weaker industries is decidedly not
a sign of prosperity.</p>

<p>But now tell me, what would you think of the prosperity
of an undertaking in which the original shareholders had
been ruined and sold their shares at a greatly depreciated
price; and this second set of shareholders again being
ruined, again sold their shares at a still further depreciated
price, whilst the third set of shareholders, obtaining their
shares at this enormously depreciated value, were able to
make some little show of temporary prosperity. Would
any business-man call that a prosperous undertaking?</p>

<p>Now this is precisely the case with Ireland. Under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>Encumbered Estates Act, thousands were reduced to beggary,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>
and the new landlords were able to make a temporary
show of prosperity on the ruin of their predecessors. When
this was over, the still more iniquitous Land Act of 1881
was passed to complete the ruin of landlords.</p>

<p>Mr. FitzGerald, of Dublin, states that there are more than
600 cases before the Court, and that the Judges have, from
time to time, adjourned the sales rather than consent to
a “wanton sacrifice of property, for which there are no
bidders.”</p>

<p>Land, which one of the Judges declared to be worth
thirty years’ purchase, was sold for eleven years’ purchase,
and the unfortunate owner was told “You must submit to
the inevitable.”</p>

<p>But this is not all; the Land Act of 1880 has put a stop
to all possible improvement of land, for no reasonable man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
will expose himself to the risk of losing his money on
improvements, because, notwithstanding any contract he
may have made with his tenant, the Land Commission may
step in and legalize a breach of the contract.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The typical landlords in Ireland, whom you hold up for
public execration, are not rich noblemen; it would be better
for Ireland if they were, but they are mostly men of the
middle class, struggling hard to escape the pauperism your
iniquitous legislation has brought upon them.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone on one occasion said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If Great Britain has become a place where the majority can

If Mr. Gladstone, with his majority, are allowed to oppress
the minority in this way, England is no longer the place for
honest and loyal subjects.</p>

would bring, at a time when <em>legislation had imposed new and unheard of
burdens on landed property</em>. At a time of unprecedented depression in
the value of land, it called a general auction of Irish estates. <em>English
History records no more violent interference with vested interests</em> than the
provision by which this Statute forced the sale of a large portion of the
landed property at a time no prudent man would have set up an acre to
be sold by public competition.” (Tenant Right in Ireland, Butt, p. 881.)
</p>
<p>
“Estates that would have been well able to pay twice the encumbrances
laid upon them, if property was at all near its ordinary level of value, now
failed to realize enough to meet the mortgages, and the proprietors were
devoted to ruin.... The tenants complain that they have gained little
and lost much in the change from the old masters to the new.” (‘New
Ireland,’ A. M. Sullivan, p. 88.)
</p>
<p>
At the sale of Lord Gort’s property thirteen years’ purchase was the
maximum; many lots were sold at five. Some portions of the property
since resold have fetched twenty-five and twenty-seven years’ purchase.

<p>
Excessive rack-renting has been attributed to sales under this iniquitous
Encumbered Estates Act.

“In those sales persons buy small portions of property; of course their

<span class="fs70">LITTLE GREATNESS.</span></h2>


<p>M. Merimée writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“That which strikes me most in the English politics of our own
times, is its <em>littleness</em>. Everything in England is done with a view
to keep place” (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conserver les portefeuilles</span>), “and they commit all
possible faults in order to keep twenty or thirty doubtful votes. They
only disquiet themselves about the present, and think nothing of
the future.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately the <em>littleness</em> to which M. Merimée refers is
not always attended with <em>little results</em>.</p>

<p>In his anxiety to secure the Irish votes, Mr. Gladstone, by
his notorious Midlothian speeches, directly encouraged Irish
demagogues to agitate.</p>

<p>His advice was followed, and the result has been, as every
one expected, anarchy, murder, and assassination.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Froude, the historian, writing in 1880, clearly predicated
it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Gladstone will not willingly allow himself to be foiled.
Yet, if he perseveres, he may bring on the struggle so long foretold
between democracy and the rights of property, and in a great empire
like ours, with such enormous interests at stake, it is not difficult to
foresee on which side the victory will be. However this may be, the
apple of discord has been flung into Ireland, there to spread its
poison.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p></div>

<p>Let us charitably hope that the results of Mr. Gladstone’s
advice to <em>agitate</em> were not anticipated by him; but a man
who will scatter sparks in a powder magazine cannot be
held altogether guiltless of the results of the explosion that
may ensue, whether he did it in ignorant folly or with
culpable intent. Froude, alluding to the Midlothian
speeches, says:&mdash;“No statesman who understood Ireland
would ever have spoken of the ‘<em>Upas Tree</em>,’ unless he was
prepared to sanction a revolution.” Mr. Gladstone must,
therefore, be held morally responsible for the blood guiltiness&mdash;for
the atrocious crimes and murders that have
disgraced Ireland; he has sown the wind, and he has
reaped the whirlwind; he has sown agitation, and reaped
dynamite; he has not only caused anarchy by his advice,
but has encouraged it by the weakness of his policy.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>An admirer of Mr. Gladstone writes in the <cite>Westminster
Review</cite>, describing Mr. Parnell and his associates as “<em>indispensable</em>
to the <em>success of Mr. Gladstone</em>!!” A fitting
associate indeed in a work of legalized plunder is Mr.
Parnell, whom Mr. Forster denounced in the House of
Commons as the aider and abetter of assassins and murderers;
who dared not stand up and answer the scathing
denunciation, but slunk off to America like a whipped
hound.</p>

<p>Again I ask your verdict of guilty or not guilty? Are
your Right Hon’ble Rulers either incompetent or dishonest,
to have made such prophesies? It was not for want of warning
that they have blundered so hopelessly. The whole
country rang with warnings<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> that the measure was one of
confiscation. Even Mr. Parnell predicted it, telling his
hearers that there would be no buyers, and the tenants would
have “an opportunity of purchasing their holdings under
the Bright Clause.”</p>

<p>The whole measure is one which commenced by breach of
faith and ended in confiscation.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Mr. James Lowther, M.P., has been blamed for saying,
that “loyal subjects have been deliberately plundered by
the Land Act.”</p>

<p>Let us see how the political economist defines “plunder:”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When a portion of wealth passes out of the hands of him who
has acquired it without his consent and without compensation,
whether by force or artifice, to him who has not created it, I say
that property is violated, that <em>plunder is perpetrated</em>.... If
the law itself performs the action it ought to repress, I say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span><em>plunder is still perpetrated</em>, and even in a social point of view, <em>under
aggravated circumstances</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p></div>

<p>Now tell me, my Friend, how do the instances I have
given above differ from legalized <span class="smcap">Plunder</span> as defined by
Bastiat?</p>

<p>When Judge Flannagan says, “you must submit to the
inevitable,” he says, in fact, “<em>you must submit to be legally
plundered</em>.”</p>

<p>When Judge Ormsby says “no one could foresee what
would occur,” he says in fact, “no one could foresee that the
law would become an instrument of <em>plunder</em>.”</p>

<p>No one could foresee it? Why, every one with common
sense could foresee it&mdash;every one but those wilfully blind.
An admirer of Mr. Gladstone naively writes in the <cite>Westminster
Review</cite> respecting the Land Act:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The people of the United States would not have tolerated
such an interference with the laws of contract as it involved. No

<p>And he might have added <em>indefensible from every point of
view</em>.</p>

<p>Froude, the historian, says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was England which introduced landowning and landlords
into Ireland as an expedient for ruling it. If we choose now to remove
the landlords or divide their property with their tenants, we

<span class="fs70">DEAR CHEAP FOOD.</span></h2>


<p>Don’t you see, what a fallacy underlies your cry for cheap
bread. Does the consumer eat nothing but bread? Is everything
to be sacrificed to the consumer? Don’t you see that
cheap bread is not all that is necessary to prosperity.</p>

<p>Have not you seen that, during one year of greatest prosperity,
the price of wheat rose to 58<em>s.</em> 8<em>d.</em> per quarter, far
higher than it was in ten years, 1831&ndash;40, before the repeal
of the Corn Laws, whilst during the present time of depression
it is down to 41<em>s.</em> 5<em>d.</em>, and that, in 1835, before the
repeal of the Corn Laws, it was down to 39<em>s.</em> 4<em>d.</em><a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>Cannot you see that cheap food is dear if the causes of its
cheapness deprive the labourer of that employment which
enables him to purchase it? Cannot you see that, although
a healthy competition stimulates production, a crushing
competition in the end causes the rise of prices by the
lessening of production?</p>

<p>Do you not know that, in the opinion of many political
economists, dear food has been considered a cause of progress
and prosperity to a nation, by stimulating its inhabitants to
exertion and thrift,&mdash;notably so in the case of Holland?</p>

<p>Do you not know that, in many countries, where food is
cheap, the natives are degraded and wretched?</p>

<p>Cannot you see that the revenue of the country must be
raised in some manner, and if a tax be put on corn, it may
be <em>taken off some other article</em> of consumption, almost equally
important? and therefore that, if the substitute be judiciously
chosen, the tax on it comes back to the consumer in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
some shape or other? Do you not know that an import tax
does not always fall on the consumer?<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>Cannot you see that the want of a <em>light</em> tax on corn (I do
not defend the Corn Laws as they existed, for they imposed
an excessive tax) has ruined agriculture, and you are preparing
for yourself a serious difficulty? In case of war with
any combination of strong maritime powers<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> wheat will rise
to famine rates.</p>

<p>Don’t you see that if we transferred a small portion of the
tax on tea, sugar, coffee, &amp;c., giving a preference to our
dependencies in the case of wheat, we should not only encourage
our home, but also our colonial, industries, which
are trembling in the balance between existence and nonexistence
for want of some slight fostering care.</p>

<p>You are like Nero fiddling while Rome was burning.
You are fiddling with your Free Trade, whilst England is
going to ruin.</p>

<p>How can it be otherwise? Unlimited foreign competition
must necessarily end in disaster. Don’t you see that you
are handicapping your people in every way. They have
higher wages than other nations. You tax them more
heavily, and you pass enactments to prevent their working
long hours. You thereby place them at a disadvantage
with people who are thrifty and industrious and are not
restricted in their hours of work. The same amount of
money now buys only half the labour it did forty years ago,
this increases the cost of production. Competition forces
your manufacturers to work only three or four days a week.
This again increases it. Increased leisure gives opportunities
for intemperance. This again has a deteriorating
effect on produce. Your best hands emigrate to prosperous
countries not cursed with free trade,&mdash;another cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
deterioration in quality of manufactures. The cheap
freights, almost nominal, place foreign productions in
England at prices very little beyond that at which they can
be produced in their native country.</p>

<p>The money spent on foreign produce, instead of being
spent in England, is so much capital taken away from this
country, helping foreigners to compete with you. You have,
in fact, in Free Trade, the most ingeniously devised plan of
impoverishing the country. We had a good start, and other
countries have been a long time in catching us up, so that
we did not feel their competition at first, but they are now
passing us hand over hand. English pluck, English capital,
and English credit have until now stood the strain bravely,
and the general advance of the wealth of the world has
blinded our eyes to our real danger, but the struggle cannot
last much longer. Capital is draining out to protectionist
countries in all directions, but the amount at stake in our
manufactories is so enormous that the struggle must be
continued at any risk. Credit alone sustains the fabric, and
as soon as that is thoroughly shaken, the collapse will be
terrible and sudden. The working classes, so long as they
receive higher wages than before, are unable to see the
danger, but when the collapse comes&mdash;and come it surely
will before long&mdash;the working classes will be the first to
demand protection. There are symptoms of it already, for
Sir Edward Sullivan has stated:&mdash;</p>

on producers, and sometimes on the intermediate agent. When a duty
is imposed on a foreign commodity, which the importing country has
facilities for producing at home, in ordinary cases the duty falls, in the
first instance, on the consumer; but when the duty has the effect of
increasing competition, the tendency is to a reduction in price, and therefore
to the ultimate benefit of the consumers. As the duty equalizes the
conditions of production between the local and foreign producers, it enables
an entirely new class of competitors to enter the field,&mdash;namely, the local
producers; and as the circle of competition becomes extended, the rivalry
among producers becomes keener, and prices become lower; for competition
inevitably leads to this when it is genuine and not a monopoly in
disguise, as is often the case. If the duty fails to increase competition, it
goes direct into the treasury as revenue; if it fails partially as a revenue
tax, owing to the local producer contributing part of the supply, and paying
no duty, the competition between the local and foreign producers will
cause a reduction in price to the consumer, so that the falling off in the
revenue will in some measure be compensated for. If the revenue from
duty fail altogether, owing to the local article taking the place of the imported
and duty-paying article, a three-fold benefit will be secured. The
consumer will gain by a reduction in the price of commodities; the public
will gain by increased employment of labour and capital; and, lastly, the
State will gain by increased revenue from the additional number of revenue-producing
population, supported by the new industry. (David Syme.
<cite>Fortnightly Review</cite>, April, 1873.)

<p>
So with the English shipping dues, which, as a matter of fact, are not
paid by the merchants or consumers, but by the shipowners.
</p>
<p>
In answer to a deputation which waited on the Chancellor of the Exchequer
recently, Mr. Lowe, <em>adopting the popular view on the question</em>,
attempted to explain that the shipowners did not pay the dues out of
their own pockets, that they only advanced the money to the merchant,
that the merchant again indemnified himself by raising the price of goods
to the consumer. But it appeared that in this particular case <em>Mr. Lowe’s
theory did not square with the facts</em>, as the deputation, which consisted of
the leading shipowners in England, positively assured him that no such
transfer took place.

<p>
A tax may, under certain conditions, have the very opposite effect from
that which it usually has, for instead of increasing the price of a commodity
it may have the effect of diminishing it. (This has been the case with
cotton in America, as shewn by the evidence given before the Select Committee
of the House of Commons, in 1840.) (<cite>Fortnightly Review</cite>, 1873.)</p></div>

<span class="fs70">THE PAGODA TREE.</span></h2>


<p>What has become of the Pagoda tree? Is it a myth? Did
it ever exist?</p>

<p>These are questions which you must have heard over and
over again.</p>

<p>Have you ever tried to answer them? No!</p>

<p>Well! let me do so.</p>

<p>The Pagoda tree is <em>no myth</em>. It exists, but in a deplorably
dilapidated condition, and bears but little fruit. Your car
of Jugernāth has crushed its roots; your wheels have
excoriated its bark; you have torn down its branches to
cremate your victims. You have denied it water and
manure. Its vitality has been sadly lowered, but it is not
<em>quite</em> dead.</p>

<p>Only smash your detestable car of Jugernāth; send your
false prophets adrift; and devote a little attention to the
cultivation of the Pagoda tree; and it will flourish and bear
more fruit than it has ever borne before.</p>

<p>Let us drop metaphor a little.</p>

<p>India has every requisite for the production of unbounded
wealth&mdash;for the employment of untold capital. How is it
then that, with all the advantages it possesses, its industries
languish and struggle for bare existence, and in many cases
die out altogether? How is it that, with all its material
advantages, it does not enjoy unbounded prosperity? I
have no doubt that you will point to the increased exports
and imports of India, and claim this as an instance of
unbounded prosperity due to Free Trade. I contend that it is
wholly due to extension in railways, improvement in facilities
of transport, and that with these improvements its prosperity
ought to have been enormous. If it be prosperous, why do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>

languish and die out?</p>

<p>India has untold wealth, and wonderful natural resources,
whether agricultural, mineral, or industrial, but they are to a
great extent dormant.</p>

<p>It has coal of an excellent character, and inexhaustible in
quantity; it has fine petroleum, large supplies of timber and
charcoal; it has iron, of a purity that would make an
English iron-master’s mouth water, spread wholesale all over
the country,&mdash;in most places to be had by light quarrying
or collection from the surface; it has chrome iron capable
of making the finest Damascus blades; manganiferous ore;
splendid hematites in profusion. It has gold, silver, antimony,
tin, copper, plumbago, lime, kaolin, gypsum, precious
stones, asbestos. Soft wheat, equal to the finest Australian;
hard wheat, equal to the finest kabanka.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> It has food grains
of every description: oilseeds, tobacco, tea, coffee, cocoa,
sugar, spices, lac, dyes, cotton, jute, hemp, flax, coir, fibres
of every description; in fact, products too numerous to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>mention. Its inhabitants are frugal, thrifty, industrious,
capable of great physical exertion, docile, easily taught,
skilful in any work requiring delicate manipulation. Labour
is absurdly cheap; the soil for the most part wonderfully
productive, and capable of producing crop after crop without
any symptoms of exhaustion.</p>

<p>The present yield of wheat is about 26,500,000 quarters, or
about 9,500,000 quarters in excess of the total imports of
wheat into England; and in the Punjab alone there is cultivable
waste land sufficient to produce 12,000,000 quarters,
besides enormous parts in Burmah and other parts of India,
only requiring irrigation or population to bring them under
the plough.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>England imports annually commodities to the value of
about £148,500,000 under six heads alone,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> a large portion of
which might be diverted to India by simply adopting a
preferential tariff slightly favorable to her dependencies.
Take, for example, wheat. If England be determined to
persist in the endeavour to ruin its agricultural industry for
a political whim, a slight tax on American and Russian
wheat would suffice to turn the whole of the wheat import
trade to India and Australia. Such a tax would, I believe,
tend to lower, rather than raise, the price of wheat, because
India would steadily go in for the production of wheat, if its
calculations were not liable to be disturbed by a slight fall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>in the price of wheat in America or Russia, which may throw
back a quantity of wheat on the hands of the Indian producers
or dealers.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>Again, India suffers from a tax which prevents the export
of rice except on a tariff which is sometimes as high as 14½
per cent. on the value of the rice. This not only handicaps
India in its exports when compared with other countries,
but it drives the natives to grow less remunerative crops of
oilseeds for export, and the result of this is that, when famine
arises, there is no surplus food which might be retained from
exports, and thus prevent the painful scenes of starvation and
distress that India has witnessed of late years. To take off
the tax would prevent depletion, for no foreign country could
compete with the demand which failure of crops in any part
of India would inevitably cause.</p>

<p>There is about £32,000,000 of English capital invested in
Indian manufacturing industries, of which £18,000,000, or
more than one-half, is invested in indigo, tea, coffee, jute,
cotton, sugar, coal and iron industries, and how are these
thriving? Everywhere <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'thoughout Bengal'">throughout Bengal</ins> you see the ruins
of English Indigo factories.</p>

<p>Coffee and tea are struggling hard for existence. Planters
are ruined, and their estates bought at depreciated rates in
times of depression. This enables the industries to survive
with some show of prosperity in good times. Agricultural
industries, such as coffee or tea, draw off surplus population,
and employ them on land that would otherwise be uncultivated.
Coal is doing fairly, but not nearly so well as it
might do if our manufacturing industries prospered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Cotton manufacture sprung up under a protective tariff,
and appeared to be prospering; but selfish Manchester called
aloud for the sacrifice of the industry. The tariff was removed,
and the industry is left to struggle for life, or perish,
as it may. Several capitalists who have embarked capital in
cotton manufacture on the faith of this tariff, have lost their
money. Everywhere in India, you may see evidences of
native iron manufacture crushed out by Free Trade, with
nothing but slag heaps remaining to testify to former
prosperity. The splendid native iron being superseded by
cheap worthless iron of English manufacture. Many attempts
have been made by English capitalists to revive, or start,
fresh iron industries, but they have one and all been crushed
out for want of a little fostering protection. The latest
attempt nearly succeeded, but the modest request for a little
help was sternly refused:&mdash;What!!! Foster your industry?
What sacrilege to advocate the violation of every principle of
Jugernāth!!! and so the helpless babe was thrown under
the relentless wheels of Jugernāth. There was a crunch,&mdash;a
faint moan from the ruined shareholders,&mdash;and then all was
over. Hurrah for Jugernāth!! <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pereat</span> India!!!</p>

<p>Fair Trade! Reciprocity! Retaliation! Such are
the cries that have been raised by those who have felt the
evils of Free Trade, without fully realising the mischievous
principle involved in it.</p>

<p>England, <em>with its dependencies, if properly governed</em>, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
be independent of foreign nations for its trade, commerce,
markets and productions.</p>

<p>“Retaliation” is an action at once undignified, inexpedient
and unjust.</p>

<p>Are we to injure ourselves by the imposition of protective
tariffs, which are mischievous when unnecessary, and to
attempt to injure our neighbour, because he declines to
imitate our folly in ruining ourselves for an economic “ignis
fatuus?”</p>

<p>The only true and statesmanlike policy of a great nation
like England is to pursue the even tenor of her way,
governing the empire with its dependencies <em>as one vast
country</em>, the interests of any one portion of which should be
considered inseparable from those of the whole;&mdash;protecting
jealously every industry; seeking every possible means of
employing the labour and developing the resources of <em>all</em>;&mdash;fostering
every industry when it needs fostering, and releasing
the fostering care as soon as such care is seen to be
unnecessary; protecting only to the extent that may be
needed to prevent the decay of an existing industry, or to
enable a new industry to spring up; the primary aim being
to utilise the labour and produce of <em>the whole</em>, and to ensure
a market for the produce in our own great United
Empire.</p>

<p>With our enormous territory, two-half times as great as
that of America,&mdash;with our enormous capabilities and varied
productions, we ought, if governed rightly, to be able to
secure this; and holding such an immense area of territory
we should have no want of healthy competition without
<em>calling</em> in foreign nations to compete with us.</p>

<p>We have within our grasp an imperial policy which would
enable us to outstrip America in a far greater degree than
she is now outstripping us.</p>

<p>By an <em>imperial</em> policy I do not mean that narrow insular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
policy which takes all it can from its dependencies, and gives
nothing in return;&mdash;I do not mean that selfish policy which
drove America to separate from us, and which is now disgusting
our Colonies, and forcing them to federation&mdash;the
first step towards separation.</p>

<p>I mean a generous enlightened policy, which considers
the welfare and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'posperity of each'">prosperity of each</ins> and every dependency
identical with its own.</p>

<p>We want the federation of <em>union with England</em>, not the
federation of <em>separation from her</em>. But where are we to look
for such a policy, surely not to the littleness described by
M. Merimée, which “<em>commits all possible faults to keep a few
doubtful votes</em>&mdash;the policy that <em>disquiets itself about the present,
and thinks nothing of the future</em>,”&mdash;not to the politicians who
put party before nation,&mdash;not to the petty caucuses of those
economic charlatans who have impoverished the empire.
We want an extension of franchise, but not <em>mob franchise</em>
such as Chamberlain and his crew propose. We want
extension of franchise to India and the Colonies. We want,
in the House of Commons, representatives of the interests of
England’s dependencies. We want practical, far-seeing, intelligent
men&mdash;those who have seen the world in its different
aspects, and know, by experience, its wants; not mere
“globe-trotters” and travelling M.P.s, who return to their
country more ignorant and puffed up with their partial
knowledge than when they started; but representative men
who have lived out of England long enough to have shaken
off the idea that their “Little Pedlington,”&mdash;be it London
or Liverpool, or Manchester or Birmingham,&mdash;is the pivot
on which the world revolves. We want in fact an Imperial
Parliament, not a wretched caucus of narrow-minded party
politicians, whose view is limited to the horizon of the
coming election, and whose whole business in life is to stump
the country, making flatulent speeches, with exuberant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
verbosity, to gaping admirers, and pandering to the fleeting

reasoned system has been adopted. The wrong theory is given up, but
what is the right theory?&mdash;There is only one alternative. If the colonies
are not in the old phrase, possessions of England, then they must be a
part of England; and we must adopt this view in earnest.
</p>
<p>
We must cease altogether to say that England is an island off the north
western coast of Europe, that it has an area of 120,000 square miles and a
population of thirty odd millions.
</p>
<p>
We must cease to think that emigrants when they go to the colonies,
leave England or are lost to England. We must cease to think that the
history of England is the history of the Parliament that sits at Westminster,
<em>and that the affairs that are not discussed there cannot belong to
English history</em>.
</p>
<p>
When we have accustomed ourselves to contemplate the whole Empire
together, and call it all England, we shall see that here too is a United
States.
</p>
<p>
Here too is a great, homogeneous people, one in blood, language, religion
and laws, but disposed over a boundless space. We shall see that though
it is held together by strong moral ties, it has little that can be called a
constitution; no system that seems capable of resisting any severe shock.
But if we are disposed to doubt whether any system can be devised capable
of holding together communities so distant from each other, then is the
time to recollect the history of the United States of America. For they
have such a system. They have solved this problem. They have shown
that in the present age of the world political unions may exist on a vaster
scale than was possible in former times.
</p>
<p>
No doubt our problem has difficulties of its own, immense difficulties.
But the <em>greatest of these difficulties is one which we make ourselves</em>.
</p>
<p>
It is the false preconception which we bring to the question, that the
problem is insoluble, that no such thing ever was done or ever will be
done; it is our misinterpretation of the American Revolution. (Expansion
of England, by J. R. Seely, M.A., p. 158.)</p></div></div>

<span class="fs80">DISCOURTESY <em>versus</em> ARGUMENT.</span></h2>
<hr class="r10a" />

<p class="pfs120">FREE TRADE <em>vs.</em> FAIR TRADE.</p>

<p class="pfs100"><em>Mr. Blood’s Letter to Mr. Bright.</em></p>
<hr class="r10a" />


<p class="right fs90"><span class="smcap">32, Charlotte Street, Birmingham.</span><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The Birmingham newspapers have recently
published a letter written to you by Mr. W. G. Lord, of
Bradford, on the subject of Free Trade. The letter is somewhat
brief, and it struck me that, though you might not feel called
upon to enter into correspondence on such subjects with persons
who are not your constituents, possibly you might feel more
disposed to discuss the question with an Elector of Birmingham.</p>

<p>You say, to imagine that the bad trade from which Bradford
is suffering is due to hostile tariffs, is absurd; and then, as
though in your opinion it was an unanswerable objection to
those who contend that hostile tariffs have a great deal to do
with it, you add, “<em>because you have had great prosperity with the
same tariffs</em>.” Now, I venture to submit that this is no argument
at all,&mdash;that it is merely a statement based upon false conclusions.
You are, or at least you ought to be, aware, that the
circumstances under which the trade of this country is carried
on have entirely changed during recent years. At the period
when, as you say, we “enjoyed great prosperity with the same
tariffs,” the foreign nations, which now exclude our manufactures
from their markets, were not sufficiently advanced to
do without our assistance. Whether they liked it or not, they
were compelled to buy of us largely, and, therefore, comparatively
speaking, their tariffs were harmless. Now they can not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
only dispense with the bulk of our manufactured goods, but,
in many branches of industry, can also compete with our
manufacturers in our own markets. Hence, hostile tariffs, which
were once of little moment, have become serious, and if you
look at the question from this point of view, you will probably
see that absurdity is not with those who cry out against the
hardships of foreign tariffs, but with those who, like yourself,
shut their eyes to the changes going on around them, and
blindly adhere to an old system after it has become obsolete and
absolutely mischievous. You cannot be unaware that, since
the great Exhibition of 1851, the commercial relations of this
country with other nations of the world have undergone an
entire change for the worse. Then it did seem as though
England was to become the “workshop of the world,” as the
apostles of Free Trade predicted she would be. But at that
Exhibition the manufacturers of Europe and America were
invited to inspect our machinery, were shown all the intricacies
of its mechanism, and made familiar with the secrets of our
manufactures. Among our visitors at that period were experts,
whose eyes were open wherever they went, and who have since
made good use of the information obtained. With equal good
nature&mdash;or shall I call it folly&mdash;we have sent our machinery
abroad, and skilled workmen to work it, without any
regard to consequences, and hence foreigners, who but for
the open-hearted candid nature of John Bull, would still
have been in the background, are now fully ahead of us in a
great many branches of manufacturing and commercial enterprise.
Unprejudiced persons cannot fail to see that arguments
based on a state of things which existed thirty or forty years
ago, have no force, now that state of things has passed away;
and your contention that hostile tariffs have nothing to do with
our commercial depression, because under the same tariffs we
enjoyed prosperity years ago, falls to the ground. On the
contrary, unless our prosperity is to still further decline, it
becomes a matter of vital necessity that in those manufactures
in which England can still keep the lead, she shall have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
same privileges as she ungrudgingly gives to others; or that we
should be protected in our markets from those who refuse us
admission to theirs.</p>

<p>You go on to say “to suppose your case will be improved by
refusing to buy what you want from foreigners, to punish them
for not buying freely from you, is an idea and scheme only
worthy of the inmates of a lunatic asylum.” But, if you
seriously believe this statement, you must believe also that the
astute, far-seeing citizen of the United States,&mdash;the plodding,
theorizing German,&mdash;the thrifty and ingenious Frenchman,&mdash;and
the hard-headed, practical Russian,&mdash;the intelligent
Italian,&mdash;and even the hard-working Swede and Norwegian,
are all lunatics. Are you prepared, seriously, to assert this as
your belief? The fact is, you adopt an ingenious way of misstating
a principle. No one thinks of refusing to buy from the
foreigner when it is to our interest to do so. In our commercial
relations one with another, it is usual for every man to buy
from one who will probably become a return purchaser, or to
put it in plainer language, each man supports the person who
will be most likely to support him in return. But in buying
from the foreigner, we are buying from the man who will never
buy from us if he can possibly help it, and leaving those who
would be our customers in return to starve.</p>

<p>Again, you say, that “to return to Protection under the name
of Reciprocity, is to confess to the Protectionists abroad that we
have been wrong, and that they are right.” But the fact is, no
such confession is necessary. The Protectionist abroad knows
<em>too well</em> that he is right, without any confession on our part.
The vast progress of the United States, the immense strides
they have made in commerce, manufactures, and wealth&mdash;strides
so vast that our own progress, even at its greatest, is insignificant&mdash;will
convince every intelligent American that the
principle of protection to native industry is, under many circumstances,
wholesome and necessary. The same may be said of
France, which has made even greater progress in some particulars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
than ourselves; and of Russia, which, under protection,
seems likely to come to the fore.</p>

<p>Again, you ask, “Who dares to propose another <em>sliding scale
or fixed duty on the import of foreign corn</em>?” Are you not aware
that even amongst your own constituents there is a large party
who have the courage to do this? You take it for granted that
good seasons would enable agriculturists to carry on their
avocation with profit. But many persons who have the best
practical acquaintance with the subject think differently. If,
in the result, they should prove to be right, are you prepared to
see the bulk of the land of the country go out of cultivation
rather than impose a duty on the import of foreign corn? With
agriculture ruined, and its capital absolutely gone, what would
become of our home trade? But the fact is, we don’t want any
foreign corn at all. Our Colonists, who could be induced to trade
with us on reciprocal terms, could supply us with all the corn we
want, even though not one single quarter of foreign grain found
a place in our markets. The result might be a very trivial rise
in the price of bread-stuffs for a few years, but I venture to
submit that the disadvantage of this rise would be more than
counterbalanced by larger revenues from imports, which would
result in reduced direct taxation, not only to the farmer, but to
all classes, and by the increased occupation <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'for the artizan'">for the artisan</ins> and
labourer, which would result from the extension of our Colonial
markets, and from keeping our home trade to ourselves.</p>

<p>As this is a question which, at the present time, is agitating
the public mind, and every one is looking for some practical
solution of existing difficulties, I shall be glad to have your
opinion on the views expressed in this letter. Your previous
communication has been widely circulated through the Press,
and, therefore, I purpose in due course, to publish this letter also,
together with any reply with which you may favour me.</p>

<p class="center"><em>Mr. Blood’s Reply to Mr. Bright.</em></p>

<p class="right smcap">32, Charlotte Street, Birmingham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am in receipt of your reply to my previous communication
on the Subject of Free Imports. You decline to discuss
the question, and in adopting this course, possibly you act
wisely. There is so very little to be said from your point of
view in favour of our existing system, that I can understand
your reluctance to state your case fully. Whether dignified
silence would not have been preferable to the uncourteous and
dogmatic assertions in which you take refuge, is another matter.
You seem surprised that any one should believe in the possibility
of our doing without “Foreign” wheat, but is your surprise
real or feigned? Do you wish to mislead the public by inducing
it to attach a wrong meaning to the word “foreign?”
You know the meaning I attach to it, and you know further
that my statement was absolutely true, and that it has often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
been made in public by persons who have a greater claim to a
hearing on this subject than yourself.</p>

<p>I stated, that our Colonies and Dependencies could supply us
with all the wheat we require, and that we could do without
any foreign supply. Do you doubt this statement? If so,
the doubt is scarcely creditable to your intelligence, or to your
industry in making yourself acquainted with the facts. You
may fix yourself on the horns of which ever dilemma you please,
but the public will hold you guilty of a want of information,
which is unpardonable, or else of a desire to mislead. Happily,
our Colonies are not foreign powers, however much the policy
of the government of which you are a member has recently
tended to drive them to become such. Hence my statement
holds good. I can only imagine that you presumed upon the
scanty information of many of your constituents as to the
difference in the meaning of the two words “Foreign” and
“Colonial,” and trusted to throw dust in their eyes by this
means. If your opinions require to be supported in this dishonourable
manner, I can only say that they are manifestly
unsound, and the sooner they are renounced the better for your
political reputation. The position you hold in Her Majesty’s
Government, although a lucrative one, is generally regarded as a
sinecure, and, therefore, I fail to see how you can plead want of
time as an excuse for writing a discourteous and contemptuous
letter to one of your constituents, who wrote you in perfect
good faith. But I shall leave it to public opinion to judge as to
whether such conduct is worthy of the prefix of “Right
Honourable” which is now generally attached to your name.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to add that no one proposes to tax the
imports of Colonial wheat to the same extent as that of foreign
growth, and for this reason; the Colonists are willing to adopt
a differential duty,&mdash;that is, to trade with us on something like
reciprocal terms. The foreigner will take no steps towards
meeting us fairly; hence the difference between the two cases
is apparent at once. Supposing a duty of 20 per cent. were
imposed on Foreign, and 10 per cent. on Colonial, wheat, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
well known that this would not increase the price of the four-pound
loaf more than a half-penny. To an average working
man’s family this would not enhance the cost of living more
than fourpence a week, and as it can easily be shown that
increased employment for labour would follow on the judicious
adoption of import duties, the working classes would be large
gainers, especially as the revenue derived from these duties
would enable us to reduce our other taxation.</p>

<p>In a former letter to me you stated that the price of the loaf
would be doubled if we had not Free Trade in corn. It would
be interesting to know how you arrived at this conclusion. I
fear your usual method of assertion, without any endeavour to
arrive at the truth, was at the bottom of it. The statement
was altogether without foundation, although, no doubt, many
people who have no time to think out the matter for themselves
were influenced by it. You are now legislating for the people
of Ireland, but has it never struck you that the immense flood
of importations from America, which has been poured upon
Ireland, has been the cause of much of the suffering which that
country has endured? It has rendered agriculture unprofitable
both in Ireland and in England, and therefore labourers have
been thrown out of work, while farmers, especially the smaller
ones, have been steadily impoverished. The natural result of
poverty is sedition. The agricultural classes having no money
to spend, all classes have suffered. Just now there is a cry for
fostering manufactures in Ireland, but how many manufactures
can you foster in which foreign competitors cannot undersell
you in the streets of Dublin? If matters go on, they may
perhaps eventually end in an attempted revolution, and if not
put down with the strong arm of force, there will be a separation.
How long in that case would Ireland, under the rule of
her own people, allow America to drain away her wealth and
prosperity? The foreign competition, against which agriculturists
have to contend, will shortly be intensified by increased
importations of beef and mutton from Queensland and other parts
of Australia, and the struggle in England will become keener,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
while Ireland will find it impossible to continue any of the small
exports of cattle and food she now sends us, except at still more
unprofitable prices.</p>

<p>This letter is somewhat lengthy, but the abrupt and discourteous
nature of your communication has led me to write
more fully than I should otherwise have done.</p>

<span class="fs80 lsp2">UNHEEDED WARNINGS.</span></h2>

<p class="pfs80">The three F’s: Fixity of Tenure, Fair Rent, Freedom of Sale.</p>

<p class="right fs80"><cite>Contemporary Review</cite>, February, 1881.</p>
<hr class="r10a" />

<p>The grounds on which the principle of the three F’s were
opposed in 1880:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><em>The Act of 1870 was to be final, and it is a breach of faith to reopen
the land question.</em></p>

<div class="blocka">

<p>&nbsp; 1. The Land Act of 1870 was an encroachment on the rights of
landlords, but was allowed to pass on the understanding
that it would be final.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 2. To reopen the question with <em>further</em> confiscation is a gross
breach of faith.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 3. More especially it is a breach of faith with those landowners
who have, on the invitation of Government,
purchased land in the “Encumbered Estates Court.”
The indefeasible title granted to them by the Court (and
for which they paid large sums) would be turned into a
mere claim to a precarious rent charge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>


<p><em>The three F’s are an infringement of the rights of the landlord. He
must be compensated for the material, moral, and sentimental
wrong which he will suffer.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp; 4. “Tenant right” is landlord wrong.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 5. Land is the absolute undoubted property of the landlord,
and he has a right to do that which he wills with his
own. Any curtailment of his power is an injustice, and
affects the very principle of property.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 6. If the State interferes with his freedom of action, and
causes him any material, moral, or sentimental injury, it
must properly compensate him.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 7. To take away the enjoyment, control, and management of
his land is a very tangible infringement of rights, and
one for which compensation must be given.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 8. To fix a rent is to deprive the landlord of the advantages
of competition, and affects him financially.</p>

<p>&nbsp; 9. It would reduce him to the position of a mere mortgagee,
but without the security and certainty of payment.</p>

<p>10. To deprive him of his power of eviction, is to take away a
privilege, a necessity.</p>

<p>11. The tenant’s claim to a “right” in the soil is not founded
on any tangible or real historical basis.</p></div>


<p class="center"><em>The abuse of eviction or raisings of rent is rare; the use is necessary
and justifiable.</em></p>

<div class="blocka">

<p>12. There is little or no abuse of the power of arbitrary
eviction; and even when rent is not paid, the landlords,
as a class, are lenient. It is occasionally necessary for
the good of the estate to evict (compensation for “disturbance”
being paid) in order to consolidate holdings.</p>

<p>13. Eviction is seldom enforced, except in the case of bad and
wasteful tenants; good and improving tenants are never
evicted. Therefore, any diminution in the power of
eviction would be disastrous to the prosperity of the
country by retaining on the land worthless tenants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>14. Most landlords do properly compensate their tenants for
any improvements effected by them.</p>

<p>15. They are justified in raising the rents when the land produces
greater increase.</p>

<p>16. Even if a few bad landlords injure their tenants, it is
unfair to visit on the heads of the majority the sins of
the few by bringing them all under the same confiscating
law.</p>

<p>17. The existing law provides ample safeguards against
arbitrary and unjust eviction; the landlord’s power is
sufficiently curtailed.</p></div>


<p class="center"><em>The relations of landlord and tenant are those of contract; the State
must not interfere in freedom of contract.</em></p>

<div class="blocka">

<p>18. Any State interference in contract between man and man is
very inexpedient and demoralizing, more especially in
interference in the matter of price and value.</p>

<p>19. The relations between landlord and tenant are merely those
of contract.</p>

<p>20. The movement of progressive societies is from status to
contract, and not the reverse.</p>

<p>21. It is illogical and unfair of the tenant to demand freedom
of contract in the sale of tenant-right, and ask for
curtailment of contract in his dealings with the landlord.</p></div>


<p class="center"><em>The objections to a fixed rent; and the difficulties in the way of fixing
a fair rent.</em></p>

<div class="blocka">

<p>22. It would be impossible to fix a rent which would content
both parties.</p>

<p>23. As tenants vary in ability, character, and energy, it would
be impossible to legislate so that the rent the tenant
had to pay would be that which he is able to pay.</p>

<p>24. A fixed rent, even if fair at first, would soon weigh heavily
on one or other of the parties.</p>

<p>25. All future enhancements of rent, based on whatever
ground, would be strenuously resisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>26. While the landlord would be bound to accept the valuation,
the tenant could refuse to pay it and quit his
holding.</p>

<p>27. If the Government, by valuation or arbitration, were to fix
the rent, the landlord would consider that he had been
guaranteed his rent by the State; while the tenant (in
bad seasons) would look to the State to assist him to
pay it.</p>

<p>28. If fixity of tenure were conceded, the next demand would
be for the abolition of the rent charge, more especially
on the ground of increased absenteeism, which would
itself have been encouraged by the change.</p>

<p>29. At all events, in bad seasons, a demand would be made for
abatement of rent, on the ground that otherwise the
value of the tenant-right would be injuriously affected.</p>

<p>30. The power conceded to the landlord of selling the “tenant-right”
on breach of contract, would be rendered nugatory
by the combination of tenants to prevent a purchase;
and so the landlord would be deprived of all means of
obtaining his rent, or of preventing subletting or subdivision.</p>

<p>31. It is illogical and unjust that, in the matter of rent, the
landlord should be deprived of the benefits of competition,
while in the sale of tenant-right competition should
be allowed.</p>

<p>32. The landlords, bound by a hard-and-fast rule, would
expect to receive their full fixed rents, and would not be
willing or able, as they are now, to allow indulgences in
time or remission in bad seasons.</p>

<p>33. The pressure of violence would be brought to bear on the
valuators to induce them to undervalue the rents.</p>


<p><em>The right of free sale of “tenant-right” would amount to confiscation
of part of the landlord’s property. It would benefit only existing
tenants, and would cripple all future tenants.</em></p>

<p>34. As the existing tenants would, on the day of the passing
of the law, be able to sell their tenant-right for a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
sum, <em>having done nothing</em> to earn it, the amount at which
it can be valued, is so much subtracted from the rightful
gains of the landlord.</p>

<p>35. As tenants had not this scheme in view when they bargained
for their farms, its adoption would be conceding
them a valuable privilege entirely at the expense of the
landlords.</p>

<p>36. Only the existing tenants would benefit pecuniarily from
the change; all future in-coming tenants would be
burdened by the amount they would have to pay for the
“tenant-right,” and the interest on this payment in
addition to the “fair” rent, would constitute a sum
exceeding any rack-rent.</p>

<p>37. The unhealthy “earth-hunger,” which exists in Ireland,
would force up the price of tenant-right far above the
real value, and thus entrench on the security of the
landlord for his rent, whilst reckless tenants would outbid
the prudent.</p>

<p>38. The payment for tenant-right would cripple the in-coming
tenant just at the moment when he most required
capital to cultivate the land&mdash;to the injury of production,
while it would leave him no margin to fall back upon in
bad times.</p>

<p>39. The tenants who would benefit most would be those who
have had indulgent landlords. When rents are low
“tenant-right” would be more valuable than when they
are high.</p>

<p>40. The tenants can obtain security of tenure by demanding
and accepting leases; many landlords are willing to
grant long leases at fixed rents on fair terms.</p>

<p>41. Therefore, at the most the law should force the landlords
to grant “security leases,” and leave them to obtain (by
means of a fine) any extra value which security will
fetch.</p>

<p>42. Any further privileges obtained by the tenant would only
be used as additional facilities for borrowing money at
ruinous rates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>43. The Ulster tenants have obtained their tenant-right by
purchase, or by a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quid pro quo</i>; the concession of free
sale would gratuitously endow existing tenants with a
valuable property, which they have neither earned,
bought, nor inherited.</p>

<p>44. Many landlords have bought up the tenant-right on their
farms; it is manifestly unfair to reimpose it without
compensation.</p>


<p><em>The landlords have largely invested capital in the soil; the three F’s
would prevent them in future from making improvements; and
the tenants’ power to do so would also be diminished.</em></p>

<p>45. The landlords, as a class, have invested capital very largely
in the improvement of the soil; the improvements have
been by no means entirely effected by the tenant.</p>

<p>46. It would no longer be to the interest of the landlord to
invest his capital in the soil; an effectual obstacle would
have been placed in the way of his doing so.</p>

<p>47. Therefore, those improvements,&mdash;drainage, straightening
fields and boundaries, &amp;c., which affect many holdings,
and can only be done by the landlord, would no longer
be executed.</p>

<p>48. As he will have to pay for the “tenant-right,” the in-coming
tenant will have less capital to invest in the soil
than at present, while the sum he has paid will be taken
out of the land for ever; thus, on both hands, the capital
available for these purposes would be diminished, and
production would suffer.</p></div>


<p class="center"><em>Further evils which would result from the adoption of the three F’s.</em></p>

<div class="blocka">

<p>49. By making the landlord merely a rent-charger, and depriving
him of all power or interest in his land, absenteeism
and non-residence, with their attendant evils,
would be enormously increased.</p>

<p>50. The proposed scheme would perpetuate the present system
of landlord and tenant, while the desirable aim should
be to increase the number of proprietors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>51. The tenant, possessing security of tenure, would be less
desirous of purchasing land, while sale, except to the
tenant, would be greatly hindered.</p>

<p>52. It would perpetuate the absurd distribution of land at
present existing in many parts of Ireland.</p>

<p>53. While it would confirm not only good and bad tenants in
their tenure of land and affect equally good and bad
landlords,</p>

<p>54. It would increase the antagonism between the landlord and
the tenant;</p>

<p>55. It would be practically impossible to prevent subdivision
and subletting with their manifold attendant evils.</p>

<p>56. The Irish people are so miserably lazy, thriftless, and
short-sighted, that no reform of the land-law would
benefit them.</p>

<p>57. <em>Nothing short of separation from England will satisfy the
Irish</em>; land-reforms are useless.</p>

<p>58. Under small proprietors or semi-proprietors, the lot of
labourers would be harder than ever.</p>

<p>59. The various parts of Ireland differ so much in every way
that it would be inexpedient and impossible to apply one
scheme to the whole; if it answered in one part it
would necessarily fail in others.</p>

<p>60. If the principle of the three F’s were once conceded, it
would form a precedent for land-legislation in England;
and then for legislation directed against all forms of
property.</p>

<p>61. It is the first step towards democratic and socialistic legislation.</p>

<p>62. The concession is the more dangerous, inasmuch as it is
only conceded to clamour and lawlessness.</p></div>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
